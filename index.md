## 1.Introduction
The LISFLOOD model is a hydrological rainfall-runoff model that is
capable of simulating the hydrological processes that occur in a
catchment. LISFLOOD has been developed by the floods group of the
Natural Hazards Project of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the
European Commission. The specific development objective was to produce a
tool that can be used in large and trans-national catchments for a
variety of applications, including:

-   Flood forecasting

-   Assessing the effects of river regulation measures

-   Assessing the effects of land-use change

-   Assessing the effects of climate change

Although a wide variety of existing hydrological models are available that are suitable for *each* of these individual tasks, few *single* models are capable of doing *all* these jobs. Besides this, our objective requires a model that is spatially distributed and, at least to a certain extent, physically-based. Also, the focus of our work is on European catchments. Since several databases exist that contain pan-European information on soils (King *et al.*, 1997; Wösten *et al.*, 1999), land cover (CEC, 1993), topography (Hiederer & de Roo, 2003) and meteorology (Rijks *et al.*, 1998), it would be advantageous to have a model that makes the best possible use of these data. Finally, the wide scope of our objective implies that changes and extensions to the model will be required from time to time. Therefore, it is essential to have a model code that can be easily maintained and modified. LISFLOOD has been specifically developed to satisfy these requirements. The model is designed to be applied across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. LISFLOOD is grid-based, and applications so far have employed grid cells of as little as 100 metres for medium-sized catchments, to 5000 metres for modelling the whole of Europe and up to 0.1° (around 10 km) for modelling globally. Long-term water balance can be simulated (using a daily time step), as well as individual flood events (using hourly time intervals, or even smaller). The output of a "water balance run" can be used to provide the initial conditions of a "flood run". Although the model's primary output product is channel discharge, all internal rate and state variables (soil moisture, for example) can be written as output as well. In addition, all output can be written as grids, or time series at user-defined points or areas. The user has complete control over how output is written, thus minimising any waste of disk space or CPU time.

## About LISFLOOD

The LISFLOOD model is implemented in the PCRaster Environmental Modelling language Version 3.0.0 (Wesseling et al., 1996), wrapped in a Python based interface. PCRaster is a raster GIS environment that has its own high-level computer language, which allows the construction of iterative spatio-temporal environmental models. The Python wrapper of LISFLOOD enables the user to control the model inputs and outputs and the selection of the model modules. This approach combines the power, relative simplicity and maintainability of code written in the the PCRaster Environmental Modelling language and the flexibility of Python.
LISFLOOD runs on any operating for which Python and PCRaster are available. Currently these include 32-bits Windows (e.g. Windows XP, Vista, 7) and a number of Linux distributions.

## About this User Manual

This revised User Manual documents LISFLOOD version December 1 2013, and replaces all previous documentation of the model (e.g. van der Knijff & de Roo, 2008; de Roo *et. al.*, 2003). The scope of this document is to give model users all the information that is needed for successfully using LISFLOOD.
Chapter 2 explains the theory behind the model, including all model equations and the changes to the previous version. The remaining chapters cover all practical aspects of working with LISFLOOD. Chapter 3 to 8 explains how to setup LISFLOOD, how to modify the settings and the outputs.
A series of Annexes at the end of this document describe some optional features that can be activated  when running the model. Most model users will not need these features (which are disabled by default), and for the sake of clarity we therefore decided to keep their description out of the main text. The  current document does not cover the calculation of the potential evapo(transpi)ration rates that are  needed as input to the model. A separate pre-processor (LISVAP) exists that calculates these variables  from standard (gridded) meteorological observations. LISVAP is documented in a separate volume (van  der Knijff, 2006). 

## 2. Process descriptions

Overview
--------

Figure 2.1 gives an overview of the structure of the LISFLOOD model.
Basically, the model is made up of the following components:

-   a 2-layer soil water balance sub-model

-   sub-models for the simulation of groundwater and subsurface flow
    (using 2 parallel interconnected linear reservoirs)

-   a sub-model for the routing of surface runoff to the nearest river
    channel

-   a sub-model for the routing of channel flow (not shown in the
    Figure)

The processes that are simulated by the model include snow melt (not
shown in the Figure), infiltration, interception of rainfall, leaf
drainage, evaporation and water uptake by vegetation, surface runoff,
preferential flow (bypass of soil layer), exchange of soil moisture
between the two soil layers and drainage to the groundwater, sub-surface
and groundwater flow, and flow through river channels. Each of these
processes is described in more detail in the following.

<sub>Figure 2.1 Overview of the LISFLOOD model. 
$P = precipitation;$  $Int = interception;$   $EW_{int} = evaporation\  of\  intercepted\ water;$  $D_{int} = leaf\  drainage;$ $ES_a = evaporation \ from \ soil \ surface;$ $T_a = transpiration \ (water \ uptake \ by \ plant \ roots);$ $INF_{act} = infiltration; $ $R_s = surface \ runoff;$ $D_{1,2} = drainage \ from \ top- to \ subsoil;$ $D_{2,gw} = drainage \ from \ subsoil \ to \ upper \ groundwater \ zone;$ $D_{pref,gw} = preferential \ flow \ to \ upper \ groundwater \ zone; $ $D_{uz,lz} = drainage \ from \ upper- \ to \ lower \ groundwater \ zone;$ $Q_{uz} = outflow \ from \ upper \ groundwater \ zone; $ $Q_l = outflow \ from \ lower \ groundwater \ zone; $ $D_{loss} = loss \ from \ lower \ groundwater zone.$ Note that snowmelt is not included in the Figure (even though it is simulated by the model).


Treatment of meteorological input variables
-------------------------------------------

The meteorological conditions provide the driving forces behind the
water balance. LISFLOOD uses the following meteorological input
variables:

  *P*        :   Precipitation                                        [mm day^-1^]
  ---------- --- ---------------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *ET0*      :   Potential (reference) evapotranspiration rate        \[mm day^-1^\]
  *EW0*      :   Potential evaporation rate from open water surface   \[mm day^-1^\]
  *ES0*      :   Potential evaporation rate from bare soil surface    \[mm day^-1^\]
  *T~avg~*   :   Average *daily* temperature[^1]                      \[°C\]

Both precipitation and evaporation are internally converted from
*intensities* \[mm day^-1^\] to *quantities per time step* \[mm\] by
multiplying them with the time step, *∆t* (in days). For the sake of
consistency, all in- and outgoing fluxes will also be described as
*quantities per time step* \[mm\] in the following, unless stated
otherwise. *ET0*, *EW0* and *ES0* can be calculated using standard
meteorological observations. To this end a dedicated pre-processing
application has been developed (LISVAP), which is documented in a
separate volume (van der Knijff, 2006).

Rain and snow
-------------

If the average temperatur is below 1°C, all precipitation is assumed to
be snow. A snow correction factor is used to correct for undercatch of
snow precipitation. Unlike rain, snow accumulates on the soil surface
until it melts. The rate of snowmelt is estimated using a simple
degree-day factor method. Degree-day factor type snow melt models
usually take the following form (e.g. see WMO, 1986):
$$M = {C_m}({T_{avg}} - {T_m})$$	


where *M* is the rate of snowmelt, *T~avg~* is the average daily
temperature, *T~m~* is some critical temperature and *C~m~* is a
degree-day factor \[mm °C^-1^ day^-1^\]. Speers *et al.* (1979)
developed an extension of this equation which accounts for accelerated
snowmelt that takes place when it is raining (cited in Young, 1985). The
equation is supposed to apply when rainfall is greater than 30 mm in 24
hours. Moreover, although the equation is reported to work sufficiently
well in forested areas, it is not valid in areas that are above the tree
line, where radiation is the main energy source for snowmelt). LISFLOOD
uses a variation on the equation of Speers *et al.* The modified
equation simply assumes that for each mm of rainfall, the rate of
snowmelt increases with 1% (compared to a 'dry' situation). This yields
the following equation:

\$$M = {C\_m} \\cdot {C\_{Seasonal}}(1 + 0.01 \\cdot R\\Delta
t)({T\_{avg}} - {T\_m}) \\cdot \\Delta t\$$ (2-2)

where *M* is the snowmelt per time step \[mm\], *R* is rainfall (not
snow!) intensity \[mm day^-1^\], and *Δt* is the time interval \[days\].
*T~m~* has a value of 0 °C, and *C~m~* is a degree-day factor \[mm
°C^-1^ day^-1^\]. However, it should be stressed that the value of
*C~m~* can actually vary greatly both in space and time (e.g. see
Martinec *et al*., 1998).

Therefore, in practice this parameter is often treated as a calibration
constant. A low value of C~m~ indicates slow snow melt. C~Seasonal~ is a
seasonal variable melt factor which is also used in several other models
(e.g. Anderson 2006, Viviroli et al., 2009). There are mainly two
reasons to use a seasonally variable melt factor:

-   The solar radiation has an effect on the energy balance and varies
    with the time of the year.

-   The albedo of the snow has a seasonal variation, because fresh snow
    is more common in the mid winter and aged snow in the late
    winter/spring. This produce an even greater seasonal variation in
    the amount of net solar radiation

Figure 2.2 shows an example where a mean value of: 3.0 mm °C^-1^ d^-1^is
used. The value of C~m~ is reduced by 0.5 at 21^st^ December and a 0.5
is added on the 21^st^ June. In between a sinus function is applied

***Figure 2.2** Sinus shaped snow melt coefficient (C~m~) as a function
of days of year*

At high altitudes, where the temperature never exceeds 1ºC, the model
accumulates snow without any reduction because of melting loss. In these
altitudes runoff from glacier melt is an important part. The snow will
accumulate and converted into firn. Then firn is converted to ice and
transported to the lower regions. This can take decades or even hundred
years. In the ablation area the ice is melted. In LISFLOOD this process
is emulated by melting the snow in higher altitudes on an annual basis
over summer. A sinus function is used to start ice melting in summer,
starting on the 15 June and ending on the 15 September (see fig 2.3) and
using the temperature of zone B (see fig 2.3.)

height="2.917361111111111in"}

***Figure 2.3** Sinus shaped ice melt coefficient as a function of days
of year*

The amount of snowmelt and icemelt together can never exceed the actual
snow cover that is present on the surface.

For large pixel sizes, there may be considerable sub-pixel heterogeneity
in snow accumulation and melt, which is a particular problem if there
are large elevation differences within a pixel. Because of this, snow
melt and accumulation are modelled separately for 3 separate elevation
zones, which are defined at the sub-pixel level. This is shown in Figure
2.4.

The division in elevation zones was changed from a uniform distribution
in the previous LISFLOOD version to a normal distribution, which fits
better to the real distribution of e.g. 100m SRTM DEM pixels in a 5x5km
grid cell. 3 elevation zones *A*, *B*, and *C* are defined with each
zone occupying one third of the pixel surface. Assuming further that
*T~avg~* is valid for the average pixel elevation, average temperature
is extrapolated to the centroids of the lower (*A*) and upper (*C*)
elevation zones, using a fixed temperature lapse rate, *L*, of 0.0065 °C
per meter elevation difference. Snow, snowmelt and snow accumulation are
subsequently modelled separately for each elevation zone, assuming that
temperature can be approximated by the temperature at the centroid of
each respective zone.

Frost index soil
----------------

When the soil surface is frozen, this affects the hydrological processes
occurring near the soil surface. To estimate whether the soil surface is
frozen or not, a frost index *F* is calculated. The equation is based on
Molnau & Bissell (1983, cited in Maidment 1993), and adjusted for
variable time steps. The rate at which the frost index changes is given
by:

\$$\\frac{{dF}}{{dt}} = - (1 - {A\_f})F - {T\_{av}} \\cdot {e\^{ - 0.04
\\cdot K \\cdot {d\_s}/w{e\_s}}}\$$ (2-4)

*dF/dt* is expressed in \[°C day^-1^ day^-1^ \]. *A~f~* is a decay
coefficient \[day^-1^\], *K* is a a snow depth reduction coefficient
\[cm^-1^\], *d~s~* is the (pixel-average) depth of the snow cover
(expressed as mm equivalent water depth), and *we~s~* is a parameter
called snow water equivalent, which is the equivalent water depth water
of a snow cover (Maidment, 1993). In LISFLOOD, *A~f~* and *K* are set to
0.97 and 0.57 cm^-1^ respectively, and *we~s~* is taken as 0.1, assuming
an average snow density of 100 kg/m^3^ (Maidment, 1993). The soil is
considered frozen when the frost index rises above a critical threshold
of 56. For each time step the value of *F* \[°C day^-1^\] is updated as:

\$$F(t) = F(t - 1) + \\frac{{dF}}{{dt}}\\Delta t\$$ (2-5)

*F* is not allowed to become less than 0.

When the frost index rises above a threshold of 56, every soil process
is frozen and transpiration, evaporation, infiltration and the outflow
to the second soil layer and to upper groundwater layer is set to zero.
Any rainfall is bypassing the soil and transformed into surface runoff
till the frost index is equal or less than 56.

Adressing sub-grid variability in land cover
--------------------------------------------

In the previous versions of LISFLOOD a number of parameters are linked
directly to land cover classes by using lookup tables. The spatially
dominant value has been used to assign the corresponding grid parameter
values. This implies that some of the sub-grid variability in land use,
and consequently in the parameter of interest, is lost (figure 2.5)

![](media/media/image12.png){width="5.66875in" height="1.8125in"}

***Figure 2.5*** Land cover aggregation approach in previous versions of
LISFLOOD

In order account properly for land use dynamics, some conceptual changes
have been made to render LISFLOOD more land-use sensitive. To account
for the sub-grid variability in land use, we model the within-grid
variability. In the modified version of the hydrological model, the
spatial distribution and frequency of each class is defined as a
percentage of the whole represented area of the new pixel. Combining
land cover classes and modeling aggregated classes, is known as the
concept of hydrological response units (HRU). The logic behind this
approach is that the non-linear nature of the rainfall runoff processes
on different land cover surfaces observed in reality will be better
captured. This concept is also used in models such as SWAT (Arnold and
Fohrer, 2005) and PREVAH (Viviroli et al., 2009). LISFLOOD has been
transferred a HRU approach on sub-grid level, as shown in figure 2.6.

land use classes separately: Percentages of forest (dark green); water
(blue), impervious surface (red), other classes (light green)

Soil model
----------

If a part of a pixel is made up of built-up areas this will influence
that pixel's water-balance. LISFLOOD's 'direct runoff fraction'
parameter (*f~dr~*) defines the fraction of a pixel that is impervious.
For impervious areas, LISFLOOD assumes that:

1.  A depression storage is filled by precipitation and snowmelt and
    emptied by evaporation

2.  Any water that is not filling the depression storage, reaches the
    surface is added directly to surface runoff

3.  The storage capacity of the soil is zero (i.e. no soil moisture
    storage in the direct runoff fraction)

4.  There is no groundwater storage

For open water (e.g. lakes, rivers) the water fraction parameter
(f~water~) defines the fraction that is covered with water (large lakes
that are in direct connection with major river channels can be modelled
using LISFLOOD's lake option, which is described in Annex 5 of this
manual). For water covered areas, LISFLOOD assumes that:

1.  The loss of actual evaporation is equal to the potential evaporation
    on open water

2.  Any water that is not evaporated, reaches the surface is added
    directly to surface runoff

3.  The storage capacity of the soil is zero (i.e. no soil moisture
    storage in the water fraction)

4.  There is no groundwater storage

For the part of a pixel that is forest (f~forest~) or other land cover
(f~other~=1-f~forest~-f~dr~-f~water~) the description of all soil- and
groundwater-related processes below (evaporation, transpiration,
infiltration, preferential flow, soil moisture redistribution and
groundwater flow) are valid. While the modelling structure for forest
and other classes is the same, the difference is the use of different
map sets for leaf area index, soil and soil hydraulic properties.
Because of the nonlinear nature of the rainfall runoff processes this
should yield better results than running the model with average
parameter values. Table 2 summarises the profiles of the four
individually modelled categories of land cover classes

If you activate any of LISFLOOD's options for writing internal model
fluxes to time series or maps (described in Chapter 8), the model will
report the real fluxes, which are the fluxes multiplied by the
corresponding fraction. Figure 2.7 illustrates this for
evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) which calculated
differently for each of this four aggregated classes. The total sum of
evapotranspiration for a pixel is calculated by adding up the fluxes for
each class multiplied by the fraction of each class.

***Figure 2.7** Simulation of aggregated land cover classes in LISFLOOD.
In this example, evapotranspiration (ET) is simulated for each
aggregated class separately (ET~fores~t, ET~dr~, ET~water~, ET~other~)*

As result of the soil model you get four different surface fluxes
weighted by the corresponding fraction
(f~dr~,f~water~,f~forest~,f~other~), respectively two fluxes for the
upper and lower groundwater zone and for groundwater loss also weighted
by the corresponding fraction (f~forest~,f~other~). However a lot of the
internal flux or states (e.g. preferential flow for forested areas) can
be written to disk as map or timeseries by activate LISFLOOD's options
(described in Chapter 8).

Interception
------------

Interception is estimated using the following storage-based equation
(Aston, 1978, Merriam, 1960):

\$$Int = {S\_{\\max }} \\cdot \[1 - \\exp ( - k \\cdot R\\Delta
t/{S\_{\\max }})\]\$$ (2-6)

where *Int* \[mm\] is the interception per time step, *S~max~* \[mm\] is
the maximum interception, *R* is the rainfall intensity \[mm day^-1^\]
and the factor *k* accounts for the density of the vegetation. *S~max~*
is calculated using an empirical equation (Von Hoyningen-Huene, 1981):

\$$\\begin{array}{l}

\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}

{S\_{\\max }} = 0.935 + 0.498 \\cdot LAI - 0.00575 \\cdot LA{I\^2} & &
\[LAI \> 0.1\]\\\\

{S\_{\\max }} = 0 & & & & & & \[LAI \\le 0.1\]

\\end{array} \\right.\\\\

\\end{array}\$$ (2-7)

where *LAI* is the average Leaf Area Index \[m^2^ m^-2^\] of each model
element (pixel). *k* is estimated as:

\$$k = 0.046 \\cdot LAI\$$ (2-8)

The value of *Int* can never exceed the interception storage capacity,
which is defined as the difference between *S~max~* and the accumulated
amount of water that is stored as interception, *Int~cum~*.

Evaporation of intercepted water
--------------------------------

Evaporation of intercepted water, *EW~int~*, occurs at the potential
evaporation rate from an open water surface, *EW0*. The *maximum*
evaporation per time step is proportional to the fraction of vegetated
area in each pixel (Supit *et al.*,1994):

\$$E{W\_{\\max }} = EW0 \\cdot \[1 - \\exp ( - {\\kappa \_{gb}} \\cdot
LAI)\]\\Delta t\$$ (2-9)

where *EW0* is the potential evaporation rate from an open water surface
\[mm day^-1^\], and *EW~max~* is in \[mm\] per time step. Constant
*κ~gb~* is the extinction coefficient for global solar radiation \[-\].
Since evaporation is limited by the amount of water stored on the
leaves, the actual amount of evaporation from the interception store
equals:

\$$E{W\_{{\\mathop{\\rm int}} }} = \\min (E{W\_{\\max }} \\cdot \\Delta
t,In{t\_{cum}})\$$ (2-10)

where *EW~int~* is the actual evaporation from the interception store
\[mm\] per time step, and *EW0* is the potential evaporation rate from
an open water surface \[mm day^-1^\]

It is assumed that on average all water in the interception store
(*Int~cum~*) will have evaporated or fallen to the soil surface as leaf
drainage within one day. Leaf drainage is therefore modelled as a linear
reservoir with a time constant (or residence time) of one day, i.e:

\$${D\_{{\\mathop{\\rm int}} }} = \\frac{1}{{{{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{int}}}}}}
\\cdot In{t\_{cum}}\\Delta t\$$ (2-11)

where *D~int~* is the amount of leaf drainage per time step \[mm\] and
*T~int~* is a time constant for the interception store \[days\], which
is set to 1 day.

Water available for infiltration and direct runoff
--------------------------------------------------

In the permeable fraction of each pixel (1- *f~dr~*), the amount of
water that is available for infiltration, *W~av~* \[mm\] equals (Supit
*et al.*,1994):

\$${W\_{av}} = R\\Delta t + M + {D\_{{\\mathop{\\rm int}} }} - Int\$$
(2-12)

where:

  *R*        : Rainfall \[mm day^-1^\]
  ---------- ---------------------------
  *M*        : Snow melt \[mm\]
  *D~int~*   : Leaf drainage \[mm\]
  *Int*      : Interception \[mm\]
  *Δt*       : time step \[days\]

Since no infiltration can take place in each pixel's 'direct runoff
fraction', direct runoff is calculated as:

\$${R\_d} = {f\_{dr}} \\cdot {W\_{av}}\$$ (2-13)

where *R~d~* is in \[mm\] per time step. Note here that *W~av~* is valid
for the permeable fraction only, whereas *R~d~* is valid for the direct
runoff fraction.

Water uptake by plant roots and transpiration
---------------------------------------------

Water uptake and transpiration by vegetation and direct evaporation from
the soil surface are modelled as two separate processes. The approach
used here is largely based on Supit *et al*. (1994) and Supit & Van Der
Goot (2000). The maximum transpiration per time step \[mm\] is given by:

\$${T\_{\\max }} = {k\_{crop}} \\cdot ET0 \\cdot \[1 - \\exp ( - {\\kappa
\_{gb}} \\cdot LAI)\]\\Delta t - E{W\_{{\\mathop{\\rm int}} }}\$$ (2-14)

Where *ET0* is the potential (reference) evapotranspiration rate \[mm
day^-1^\],

Constant *κ~gb~* is the extinction coefficient for global solar
radiation \[-\] and

*k~crop~* is a crop coefficient, a ration between the potential
(reference) evapotranspiration rate and the potential evaporation rate
of a specific crop. *k~crop~* is 1 for most vegetation types, except for
some excessively transpiring crops like sugarcane or rice.

Note that the energy that has been 'consumed' already for the
evaporation of intercepted water is simply subtracted here in order to
respect the overall energy balance. The actual transpiration rate is
reduced when the amount of moisture in the soil is small. In the model,
a reduction factor is applied to simulate this effect:

(2-15)

where *w~1~* is the amount of moisture in the upper soil layer \[mm\],
*w~wp1~* \[mm\] is the amount of soil moisture at wilting point (pF 4.2)
and *w~crit1~* \[mm\] is the amount of moisture below which water uptake
is reduced and plants start closing their stomata. The critical amount
of soil moisture is calculated as:

\$${w\_{{\\rm{crit1}}}} = (1 - p) \\cdot ({w\_{fc1}} - {w\_{wp1}}) +
{w\_{wp1}}\$$ (2-16)

where *w~fc1~* \[mm\] is the amount of soil moisture at field capacity
and *p* is the soil water depletion fraction. *R~WS~* varies between 0
and 1: negative values and values greater than 1 are truncated to 0 and
1, respectively. *p* represents the fraction of soil moisture between
*w~fc1~* and *w~wp1~* that can be extracted from the soil without
reducing the transpiration rate. Its value is a function of both
vegetation type and the potential evapotranspiration rate. The procedure
to estimate *p* is described in detail in Supit & Van Der Goot (2003).
Figure 2.8 further illustrates the relation between *RWS*, *w*,
*w~crit~*, *w~fc~*, *w~wp~*.

*Figure 2.8 Reduction of transpiration in case of water stress. R~ws~
decreases linearly to zero between* w~crit~ *and* w~wp~*.*

The actual transpiration *T~a~* is now calculated as:

\$${T\_a} = {r\_{WS}} \\cdot {T\_{\\max }}\$$ (2-17)

with *T~a~* and *T~max~* in \[mm\].

Transpiration is set to zero when the soil is frozen (i.e. when frost
index *F* exceeds its critical threshold). The amount of moisture in the
upper soil layer is updated after the transpiration calculations:

\$${w\_1} = {w\_1} - {T\_a}\$$ (2-18)

Direct evaporation from the soil surface
----------------------------------------

The maximum amount of evaporation from the soil surface equals the
maximum evaporation from a shaded soil surface, *ES~max~* \[mm\], which
is computed as:

\$$E{S\_{\\max }} = ES0 \\cdot \\exp ( - {\\kappa \_{gb}} \\cdot
LAI)\\Delta t\$$ (2-19)

where *ES0* is the potential evaporation rate from bare soil surface
\[mm day^-1^\]. The actual evaporation from the soil mainly depends on
the amount of soil moisture near the soil surface: evaporation decreases
as the topsoil is drying. In the model this is simulated using a
reduction factor which is a function of the number of days since the
last rain storm (Stroosnijder, 1987, 1982):

\$$E{S\_a} = E{S\_{\\max }} \\cdot (\\sqrt {{D\_{slr}}} - \\sqrt
{{D\_{slr}} - 1} )\$$ (2-20)

The variable *D~slr~* represents the number of days since the last rain
event. Its value accumulates over time: if the amount of water that is
available for infiltration (*W~av~*) remains below a critical threshold
it increases by an amount of *Δt* \[days\] for each time step. It is
reset to 1 only if the critical amount of water is exceeded[^2]. The
actual soil evaporation is always the smallest value out of the result
of the equation above and the available amount of moisture in the soil,
i.e.:

\$$E{S\_a} = \\min (E{S\_a},{w\_1} - {w\_{res1}})\$$ (2-21)

where *w~1~* \[mm\] is the amount of moisture in the upper soil layer
and *w~res1~* \[mm\] is the residual amount of soil moisture. Like
transpiration, direct evaporation from the soil is set to zero if the
soil is frozen. The amount of moisture in the upper soil layer is
updated after the evaporation calculations:

\$${w\_1} = {w\_1} - E{S\_a}\$$ (2-22)

Infiltration capacity
---------------------

The infiltration capacity of the soil is estimated using the widely-used
Xinanjiang (also known as VIC/ARNO) model (e.g. Zhao & Lui, 1995;
Todini, 1996). This approach assumes that the fraction of a grid cell
that is contributing to surface runoff (read: saturated) is related to
the total amount of soil moisture, and that this relationship can be
described through a non-linear distribution function. For any grid cell,
if *w~1~* is the total moisture storage in the upper soil layer and
*w~s1~* is the maximum storage, the corresponding saturated fraction
*A~s~* is approximated by the following distribution function:

\$${A\_s} = 1 - {(1 - \\frac{{{w\_1}}}{{{w\_{s1}}}})\^b}\$$ (2-23)

where *w~s1~* and *w~1~* are the maximum and actual amounts of moisture
in the upper soil layer, respectively \[mm\], and *b* is an empirical
shape parameter. In the LISFLOOD implementation of the Xinanjiang model,
*A~s~* is defined as a fraction of the permeable fraction of each pixel
(i.e. as a fraction of (1-*d~rf~*)). The infiltration capacity
*INF~pot~* \[mm\] is a function of *w~s~* and *A~s~*:

\$$IN{F\_{pot}} = \\frac{{{w\_{s1}}}}{{b + 1}} - \\frac{{{w\_{s1}}}}{{b +
1}}\[1 - {(1 - {A\_s})\^{\\frac{{b + 1}}{b}}}\]\$$ (2-24)

Note that the shape parameter *b* is related to the heterogeneity within
each grid cell. For a totally homogeneous grid cell *b* approaches zero,
which reduces the above equations to a simple 'overflowing bucket'
model. Before any water is draining from the soil to the groundwater
zone the soil has to be completely filled up. See also red line in
figure 2.9: e.g. a soil of 60% soil moisture has 40% potential
infiltration capacity. A b value of 1.0 is comparable to a leaking
bucket. See black line in figure 2.9: e.g. a soil of 60% soil moisture
has only 10% potential infiltration capacity while 30% is draining
directly to groundwater. Increasing b even further than 1 is comparable
to a sieve (see figure 2.10). Most of the water is going directly to
groundwater and the potential infiltration capacity is going toward 0.

Preferential bypass flow
------------------------

For the simulation of preferential bypass flow --i.e. flow that bypasses
the soil matrix and drains directly to the groundwater- no generally
accepted equations exist. Because ignoring preferential flow completely
will lead to unrealistic model behaviour during extreme rainfall
conditions, a very simple approach is used in LISFLOOD. During each time
step, a fraction of the water that is available for infiltration is
added to the groundwater directly (i.e. without first entering the soil
matrix). It is assumed that this fraction is a power function of the
relative saturation of the topsoil, which results in an equation that is
somewhat similar to the excess soil water equation used in the HBV model
(e.g. Lindström *et al*., 1997):

\$${D\_{pref,gw}} =
{W\_{av}}{(\\frac{{{w\_1}}}{{{w\_{s1}}}})\^{{c\_{pref}}}}\$$ (2-25)

where *D~pref,gw~* is the amount of preferential flow per time step
\[mm\], *W~av~* is the amount of water that is available for
infiltration, and *c~pref~* is an empirical shape parameter. *f~dr~* is
the 'direct runoff fraction' \[-\], which is the fraction of each pixel
that is made up by urban area and open water bodies (i.e. preferential
flow is only simulated in the permeable fraction of each pixel) . The
equation results in a preferential flow component that becomes
increasingly important as the soil gets wetter.

Figure 2.11 shows with *c~pref~* = 0 (red line) every available water
for infiltration is converted into preferential flow and bypassing the
soil. *c~pref~* = 1 (black line) gives a linear relation e.g. at 60%
soil saturation 60% of the available water is bypassing the soil matrix.
With increasing *c~pref~* the percentage of preferential flow is
decreasing.

**Figure 2.11** Soil moisture and preferential flow relation

Actual infiltration and surface runoff
--------------------------------------

The actual infiltration *INF~act~* \[mm\] is now calculated as:

\$$IN{F\_{act}} = \\min (IN{F\_{pot}},{W\_{av}} - {D\_{pref,gw}})\$$
(2-26)

Finally, the surface runoff *R~s~* \[mm\] is calculated as:

\$${R\_s} = {R\_d} + (1 - {f\_{dr}}) \\cdot ({W\_{av}} - {D\_{pref,gw}} -
IN{F\_{act}})\$$ (2-27)

where *R~d~* is the direct runoff (generated in the pixel's 'direct
runoff fraction'). If the soil is frozen (*F* \> critical threshold) no
infiltration takes place. The amount of moisture in the upper soil layer
is updated after the infiltration calculations:

\$${w\_1} = {w\_1} + IN{F\_{act}}\$$ (2-28)

Soil moisture redistribution 
-----------------------------

The description of the moisture fluxes out of the subsoil (and also
between the upper- and lower soil layer) is based on the simplifying
assumption that the flow of soil moisture is entirely gravity-driven.
Starting from Darcy's law for 1-D vertical flow:

\$$q = - K(\\theta )\[\\frac{{\\partial h(\\theta )}}{{\\partial z}} -
1\]\$$ (2-29)

where *q* \[mm day^-1^\] is the flow rate out of the soil (e.g. upper
soil layer, lower soil layer); *K(θ)* \[mm day^-1^\] is the hydraulic
conductivity (as a function of the volumetric moisture content of the
soil, *θ* \[mm^3^ mm^-3^\]) and \$$\\partial h(\\theta )/\\partial z\$$ is
the matric potential gradient. If we assume a matric potential gradient
of zero, the equation reduces to:

\$$q = K(\\theta )\$$ (2-30)

This implies a flow that is always in downward direction, at a rate that
equals the conductivity of the soil. The relationship between hydraulic
conductivity and soil moisture status is described by the Van Genuchten
equation (van Genuchten, 1980), here re-written in terms of mm water
slice, instead of volume fractions:

(2-31)

where *K~s~* is the saturated conductivity of the soil \[mm day^-1^\],
and *w*, *w~r~* and *w~s~* are the actual, residual and maximum amounts
of moisture in the soil respectively (all in \[mm\]). Parameter *m* is
calculated from the pore-size index, *λ* (which is related to soil
texture):

\$$m = \\frac{\\lambda }{{\\lambda + 1}}\$$ (2-32)

For large values of *Δt* (e.g. 1 day) the above equation often results
in amounts of outflow that exceed the available soil moisture storage,
i.e:

\$$K(w)\\Delta t \> w - {w\_r}\$$ (2-33)

In order to solve the soil moisture equations correctly an iterative
procedure is used. At the beginning of each time step, the
conductivities for both soil layers \[*K~1~(w~1~)*, *K~2~(w~2~)*\] are
calculated using the Van Genuchten equation. Multiplying these values
with the time step and dividing by the available moisture gives a
Courant-type numerical stability indicator for each respective layer:

 (2-34a)

 (2-34b)

A Courant number that is greater than 1 implies that the calculated
outflow exceeds the available soil moisture, resulting in loss of mass
balance. Since we need a stable solution for both soil layers, the
'overall' Courant number for the soil moisture routine is the largest
value out of *C~1~* and *C~2~*:

\$${C\_{soil}} = \\max ({C\_1},{C\_2})\$$ (2-35)

In principle, rounding *C~soil~* up to the nearest integer gives the
number sub-steps needed for a stable solution. In practice, it is often
preferable to use a critical Courant number that is lower than 1,
because high values can result in unrealistic 'jumps' in the simulated
soil moisture pattern when the soil is near saturation (even though mass
balance is preserved). Hence, making the critical Courant number a
user-defined value *C~crit~*, the number of sub-steps becomes:

\$$SubSteps = roundup(\\frac{{{C\_{soil}}}}{{{C\_{crit}}}})\$$ (2-36)

and the corresponding sub-time-step, *Δ't*:

\$$\\Delta \'t = \\frac{{\\Delta t}}{{SubSteps}}\$$ (2-37)

In brief, the iterative procedure now involves the following steps.
First, the number of sub-steps and the corresponding sub-time-step are
computed as explained above. The amounts of soil moisture in the upper
and lower layer are copied to temporary variables *w'~1~* and *w'~2~*.
Two variables, *D~1,2~* (flow from upper to lower soil layer) and
*D~2,gw~* (flow from lower soil layer to groundwater) are initialized
(set to zero). Then, for each sub-step, the following sequence of
calculations is performed:

1.  compute hydraulic conductivity for both layers

2.  compute flux from upper to lower soil layer for this sub-step
    (*D'~1,2~*, can never exceed storage capacity in lower layer):

\$$D{\'\_{1,2}} = \\min \[{K\_1}(w{\'\_1})\\Delta t,w{\'\_{s2}} -
w{\'\_2}\]\$$ (2-38)

3.  compute flux from lower soil layer to groundwater for this sub-step
    (*D'~2,gw~*, can never exceed available water in lower layer):

\$$D{\'\_{2,gw}} = \\min \[{K\_2}(w{\'\_2})\\Delta t,w{\'\_2} -
w{\'\_{r2}}\]\$$ (2-39)

4.  update *w'~1~* and *w'~2~*

5.  add *D'~1,2~* to *D~1,2~*; add *D'~2,gw~* to *D~2,gw~*

If the soil is frozen (*F* \> critical threshold), both *D~1,2~* and
*D~2,gw~* are set to zero. After the iteration loop, the amounts of soil
moisture in both layers are updated as follows:

\$${w\_1} = {w\_1} - {D\_{1,2}}\$$ (2-40)

\$${w\_2} = {w\_2} + {D\_{1,2}} - {D\_{2,gw}}\$$ (2-41)

Groundwater
-----------

Groundwater storage and transport are modelled using two parallel linear
reservoirs, similar to the approach used in the HBV-96 model (Lindström
et al., 1997). The upper zone represents a quick runoff component, which
includes fast groundwater and subsurface flow through macro-pores in the
soil. The lower zone represents the slow groundwater component that
generates the base flow. The outflow from the upper zone to the channel,
*Q~uz~* \[mm\] equals:

\$${Q\_{uz}} = \\frac{1}{{{{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{uz}}}}}} \\cdot UZ\\,\\Delta
t\$$ (2-42)

where *T~uz~* is a reservoir constant \[days\] and *UZ* is the amount of
water that is stored in the upper zone \[mm. Similarly, the outflow from
the lower zone is given by:

\$${Q\_{lz}} = \\frac{1}{{{{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{lz}}}}}} \\cdot LZ\\;\\Delta
t\$$ (2-43)

Here, *T~lz~* is again a reservoir constant \[days\], and *LZ* is the
amount of water that is stored in the lower zone \[mm\]. The values of
both *T~uz~* and *T~lz~* are obtained by calibration. The upper zone
also provides the inflow into the lower zone. For each time step, a
fixed amount of water percolates from the upper to the lower zone:

\$${D\_{uz,lz}} = \\min (G{W\_{perc}} \\cdot \\Delta t,\\;UZ)\$$ (2-44)

Here, *GW~perc~* \[mm day^-1^\] is a user-defined value that can be used
as a calibration constant. For many catchments it is quite reasonable to
treat the lower groundwater zone as a system with a closed lower
boundary (i.e. water is either stored, or added to the channel).
However, in some cases the closed boundary assumption makes it
impossible to obtain realistic simulations. Because of this, it is
possible to percolate a fixed amount of water out of the lower zone, as
a loss *D~loss~*:

\$${D\_{loss}} = \\min ({f\_{loss}} \\cdot \\Delta t,\\;LZ)\$$ (2-45)

In the previous version of LISFLOOD *D~loss~*, was calculated as a fixed
fraction of Q~lz~, but this leads to a high dependency of D~loss~ from
GW~perc~ and LZ. For example if either GW~perc~ or LZ is quite low the
parameter *D~loss~* turns out to be meaningless.

The loss fraction, *f~loss~* \[-\], equals 0 for a completely closed
lower boundary. If *f~loss~* is set to 1, all outflow from the lower
zone is treated as a loss. Water that flows out of the lower zone
through *D~loss~* is quite literally 'lost' forever. Physically, the
loss term could represent water that is either lost to deep groundwater
systems (that do not necessarily follow catchment boundaries), or even
groundwater extraction wells. When using the model, it is suggested to
use *f~oss~* with some care; start with a value of zero, and only use
any other value if it is impossible to get satisfactory results by
adjusting the other calibration parameters.

At each time step, the amounts of water in the upper and lower zone are
updated for the in- and outgoing fluxes, i.e.:

\$$U{Z\_t} = U{Z\_{t - 1}} + {D\_{2,gw}} - D\_{uz,lz}\^{} - {Q\_{uz}}\$$
(2-46)

\$$L{Z\_t} = L{Z\_{t - 1}} + D\_{uz,lz}\^{} - {Q\_{lz}} - {D\_{loss}}\$$
(2-47)

Note that these equations are again valid for the permeable fraction of
the pixel only: storage in the direct runoff fraction equals 0 for both
*UZ* and *LZ*.

Routing of surface runoff to channel
------------------------------------

Surface runoff is routed to the nearest downstream channel using a
4-point implicit finite-difference solution of the kinematic wave
equations (Chow, 1988). The basic equations used are the equations of
continuity and momentum. The continuity equation is:

\$$\\frac{{\\partial {Q\_{sr}}}}{{\\partial x}} + \\frac{{\\partial
{A\_{sr}}}}{{\\partial t}} = {q\_{sr}}\$$ (2-48)

where *Q~sr~* is the surface runoff \[m^3^ s^-1^\], *A~sr~* is the
cross-sectional area of the flow \[m^2^\] and *q~sr~* is the amount of
lateral inflow per unit flow length \[m^2^ s^-1^\]. The momentum
equation is defined as:

\$$\\rho {\\kern 1pt} g{A\_{sr}}({S\_0} - {S\_f}) = 0\$$ (2-49)

where *ρ* is the density of the flow \[kg m^-3^\], *g* is the gravity
acceleration \[m s^-2^\], *S~0~* is the topographical gradient and
*S~f~* is the friction gradient. From the momentum equation it follows
that *S~0~= S~f~*, which means that for the kinematic wave equations it
is assumed that the water surface is parallel to the topographical
surface. The continuity equation can also be written in the following
finite-difference form (please note that for the sake of readability the
'sr' subscripts are omitted here from *Q*, *A* and *q*):

 (2-50)

where *j* is a time index and *i* a space index (such that *i=1* for the
most upstream cell, *i=2* for its downstream neighbour, etcetera). The
momentum equation can also be expressed as (Chow et al., 1988):

\$${A\_{sr}} = {\\alpha \_{k,sr}} \\cdot {Q\_{sr}}\^{{\\beta \_k}}\$$
(2-51)

Substituting the right-hand side of this expression in the
finite-difference form of the continuity equation gives a nonlinear
implicit finite-difference solution of the kinematic wave:


(2-52)

If *α~k,sr~* and *β~k~* are known, this non-linear equation can be
solved for each pixel and during each time step using an iterative
procedure. This numerical solution scheme is available as a built-in
function in the PCRaster software. The coefficients *α~k,sr~* and *β~k~*
are calculated by substituting Manning\'s equation in the right-hand
side of Equation 2-51:

 (2-53)

where *n* is Manning\'s roughness coefficient and *P~sr~* is the wetted
perimeter of a cross-section of the surface flow. Substituting the
right-hand side of this equation for *A~sr~* in equation 2-51 gives:

 (2-54)

At present, LISFLOOD uses values for *α~k,sr~* which are based on a
static (reference) flow depth, and a flow width that equals the pixel
size, *Δx*. For each time step, all runoff that is generated (*R~s~*) is
added as side-flow (*q~sr~*). For each flowpath, the routing stops at
the first downstream pixel that is part of the channel network. In other
words, the routine only routes the surface runoff *to* the nearest
channel; no runoff *through* the channel network is simulated at this
stage (runoff- and channel routing are completely separated).

Routing of sub-surface runoff to channel
----------------------------------------

All water that flows out of the upper- and lower groundwater zone is
routed to the nearest downstream channel pixel within one time step.
Recalling once more that the groundwater equations are valid for the
pixel's permeable fraction only, the contribution of each pixel to the
nearest channel is made up of (*f~forest+~f~other~)∙(Q~uz~* + *Q~lz~)*.
Figure 2.12 illustrates the routing procedure: for each pixel that
contains a river channel, its contributing pixels are defined by the
drainage network. For every \'river pixel\' the groundwater outflow that
is generated by its upstream pixels is simply summed. For instance,
there are two flow paths that are contributing to the second \'river
pixel\' from the left in Figure 2.12. Hence, the amount of water that is
transported to this pixel equals the sum of the amounts of water
produced by these flowpaths, q1 + q2. Note that, as with the surface
runoff routing, no water is routed *through* the river network at this
stage.

is routed to the nearest 'channel' pixel.*

Channel routing
---------------

Flow through the channel is simulated using the kinematic wave
equations. The basic equations and the numerical solution are identical
to those used for the surface runoff routing:
 (2-55)

where *Q~ch~* is the channel discharge \[m^3^ s^-1^\], *A~ch~* is the
cross-sectional area of the flow \[m^2^\] and *q~ch~* is the amount of
lateral inflow per unit flow length \[m^2^ s^-1^\]. The momentum
equation then becomes:

(2-56)

where *S~0~* now equals the gradient of the channel bed, and *S~0~=
S~f~*. As with the surface runoff, values for parameter *α~k,ch~* are
estimated using Manning's equation:

(2-57)

At present, LISFLOOD uses values for *α~k,ch~* which are based on a
static (reference) channel flow depth (half bankfull) and measured
channel dimensions. The term *q~ch~* (sideflow) now represents the
runoff that enters the channel per unit channel length:

(2-58)

Here, *Q~sr~*, *Q~uz~* and *Q~lz~* denote the contributions of surface
runoff, outflow from the upper zone and outflow from the lower zone,
respectively. *Q~in~* is the inflow from an external inflow hydrograph;
by default its value is 0, unless the 'inflow hydrograph' option is
activated (see Annex 2). *Q~res~* is the water that flows out of a
reservoir into the channel; by default its value is 0, unless the
'reservoir' option is activated (see Annex 1). *Q~sr~*, *Q~uz~*,
*Q~lz~*, *Q~in~* and *Q~res~* are all expressed in \[m^3^\] per time
step. *L~ch~* is the channel length \[m\], which may exceed the pixel
size (*Δx*) in case of meandering channels. The kinematic wave channel
routing can be run using a smaller time-step than the over simulation
timestep, *Δt*, if needed.

Special simulation options
--------------------------

The above model description covers the processes that are simulated in a
'standard' LISFLOOD run. By default, special structures in the river
channel e.g. lakes and regulated reservoirs are not taken into account.
However, LISFLOOD has some optional features to model these structures.
The description of these features can be found in a series of Annexes at
the end of this manual.

Features are:

-   Including reservoirs, polder, lakes (Annex 1-3)

-   including inflow hydrographs (Annex 4)

-   using a double kinematic wave approach for channel routing (Annex 5)

-   using the diffusion wave approach instead of kinematic wave for
    channel routing (Annex 6)

-   Including transmission loss (Annex 7)

-   Using water use maps (Annex 8)

-   Simulating water levels (Annex 9)

 3. Installation of the LISFLOOD model
======================================

System requirements
-------------------

Currently LISFLOOD is available on both 64-bit Linux and 32-bit Windows
systems. Either way, the model requires that a recent version of the
PCRaster software is available, or at least PCRaster's 'pcrcalc'
application and all associated libraries. LISFLOOD require 'pcrcalc'
version November 30, 2009, or more recent. Older 'pcrcalc' versions will
either not work at all, or they might produce erroneous results. Unless
you are using a 'sealed' version of LISFLOOD (i.e. a version in which
the source code is made unreadable), you will also need a licensed
version of 'pcrcalc'. For details on how to install PCRaster we refer to
the PCRaster documentation.

Installation on Windows systems
-------------------------------

For Windows users the installation involves two steps:

1.  Unzip the contents of 'lisflood\_win32.zip' to an empty folder on
    your PC (e.g. 'lisflood')

2.  Open the file 'config.xml' in a text editor. This file contains the
    full path to all files and applications that are used by LISFLOOD.
    The items in the file are:

-   *Pcrcalc application* : this is the name of the pcrcalc application,
    including the full path

-   *LISFLOOD Master Code* (optional). This item is usually omitted, and
    LISFLOOD assumes that the master code is called 'lisflood.xml', and
    that it is located in the root of the 'lisflood' directory (i.e. the
    directory that contains 'lisflood.exe' and all libraries). If --for
    whatever reason- you want to overrule this behaviour, you can add a
    'mastercode' element, e.g.:

> **\<mastercode\>**d:\\Lisflood\\mastercode\\lisflood.xml**\</mastercode\>**

The configuration file should look something like this:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?\>                       |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- Lisflood configuration file, JvdK, 8 July 2004 \--\>             |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- !! This file MUST be in the same directory as lisflood.exe \--\> |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- (or lisflood) !!! \--\>                                          |
|                                                                         |
| **\<lfconfig\>**                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- location of pcrcalc application \--\>                            |
|                                                                         |
| **\<pcrcalcapp\>**C:\\pcraster\\apps\\pcrcalc.exe**\</pcrcalcapp\>**    |
|                                                                         |
| **\</lfconfig\>**                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The lisflood executable is a command-line application which can be
called from the command prompt ('DOS' prompt). To make life easier you
may include the full path to 'lisflood.exe' in the 'Path' environment
variable. In Windows XP you can do this by selecting 'settings' from the
'Start' menu; then go to 'control panel'/'system' and go to the
'advanced' tab. Click on the 'environment variables' button. Finally,
locate the 'Path' variable in the 'system variables' window and click on
'Edit' (this requires local Administrator privileges).

Installation on Linux systems
-----------------------------

Under Linux LISFLOOD requires that the Python interpreter (version 2.5
or more recent) is installed on the system. Most Linux distributions
already have Python pre-installed. If needed you can download Python
free of any charge from the following location:

*http://www.python.org/*

The installation process is largely identical to the Windows procedure:
unzip the contents of 'lisflood\_llinux.zip' to an empty directory.
Check if the file 'lisflood' is executable. If not, make it executable
using:

chmod 755 lisflood

Then update the paths in the configuration file. The configuration file
will look something like this:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?\>                       |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- Lisflood configuration file, JvdK, 8 July 2004 \--\>             |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- !! This file MUST be in the same directory as lisflood.exe \--\> |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- (or lisflood) !!! \--\>                                          |
|                                                                         |
| **\<lfconfig\>**                                                        |
|                                                                         |
| \<!\-- location of pcrcalc application \--\>                            |
|                                                                         |

|                                                                         |
| **\</lfconfig\>**                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Running the model
-----------------

Type 'lisflood' at the command prompt. You should see something like
this:

You can run LISFLOOD by typing 'lisflood' followed by a
specially-formatted settings file. The layout of this file is described
in Chapters 4 and 5. Chapter 3 explains all other input files.

[]{#_Toc84077416 .anchor}**4. Model setup: input files**

In the current version of LISFLOOD, all model input is provided as
either maps (grid files in PCRaster format) or tables. This chapter
describes all the data that are required to run the model. Files that
are specific to *optional* LISFLOOD features (e.g. inflow hydrographs,
reservoirs) are not listed here; they are described in the documentation
for each option.

Input maps
----------

PCRaster requires that all maps must have *identical* location
attributes (number of rows, columns, cellsize, upper x and y coordinate!

All input maps roughly fall into any of the following six categories:

-   maps related to topography

-   maps related to land cover -- fraction of land cover

-   maps related to land cover and soil

-   maps related to soil texture (soil hydraulic properties)

-   maps related to channel geometry

-   maps related to the meteorological conditions

-   maps related to the development of vegetation over time

-   maps that define at which locations output is generated as time
    series

All maps that are needed to run the model are listed in the table[^3] of
Annex 12.

### Role of "mask" and "channels" maps 

The mask map (i.e. "area.map") defines the model domain. In order to
avoid unexpected results, **it is vital that all maps that are related
to topography, land use and soil are defined (i.e. don't contain a
missing value)** for each pixel that is "true" (has a Boolean 1 value)
on the mask map. The same applies for all meteorological input and the
Leaf Area Index maps. Similarly, all pixels that are "true" on the
channels map must have some valid (non-missing) value on each of the
channel parameter maps. Undefined pixels can lead to unexpected
behaviour of the model, output that is full of missing values, loss of
mass balance and possibly even model crashes. Some maps needs to have
values in a defined range e.g. gradient.map has to be greater than 0.

### Map location attributes and distance units

LISFLOOD needs to know the size properties of each grid cell (length,
area) in order to calculate water *volumes* from meteorological forcing
variables that are all defined as water *depths*. By default, LISFLOOD
obtains this information from the location attributes of the input maps.
This will only work if all maps are in an "equal area" (equiareal)
projection, and the map co-ordinates (and cell size) are defined in
meters. For datasets that use, for example, a latitude-longitude system,
neither of these conditions is met. In such cases you can still run
LISFLOOD if you provide two additional maps that contain the length and
area of each grid cell:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

| define grid size*     |

|                       |                       | of values: map \> 0*  |

|                       |                       | *Unit:* \[m^2^\],     |
|                       |                       | *Range of values: map |
|                       |                       | \> 0*                 |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Both maps should be stored in the same directory where all other input
maps are. The values on both maps may vary in space. A limitation is
that a pixel is always represented as a square, so length and width are
considered equal (no rectangles). In order to tell LISFLOOD to ignore
the default location attributes and use the maps instead, you need to
activate the special option "*gridSizeUserDefined*", which involves
adding the following line to the LISFLOOD settings file:

\<setoption choice=\"1\" name=\"gridSizeUserDefined\" /\>

LISFLOOD settings files and the use of options are explained in detail
in Chapter 5 of this document.

### Naming of meteorological variable maps

The meteorological forcing variables (and Leaf Area Index) are defined
in *map stacks*. A *map stack* is simply a series of maps, where each
map represents the value of a variable at an individual time step. The
name of each map is made up of a total of 11 characters: 8 characters, a
dot and a 3-character suffix. Each map name starts with a *prefix*, and
ends with the time step number. All character positions in between are
filled with zeros ("0"). Take for example a stack of precipitation maps.
Table 4.1 shows that the default prefix for precipitation is "pr", which
produces the following file names:

  pr000000.007   : at time step 7
  -------------- ----------------------
  pr000035.260   : at time step 35260

LISFLOOD can handle two types of stacks. First, there are *regular*
stacks, in which a map is defined for each time step. For instance, the
following 10-step stack is a regular stack:

  **t **   **map name**
  -------- --------------
  1        pr000000.001
  2        pr000000.002
  3        pr000000.003
  4        pr000000.004
  5        pr000000.005
  6        pr000000.006
  7        pr000000.007
  8        pr000000.008
  9        pr000000.009
  10       pr000000.010

In addition to regular stacks, it is also possible to define *sparse*
stacks. A *sparse* stack is a stack in which maps are not defined for
all time steps, for instance:

  **t **   **map name**
  -------- --------------
  1        pr000000.001
  2        \-
  3        \-
  4        pr000000.004
  5        \-
  6        \-
  7        pr000000.007
  8        \-
  9        \-
  10       \-

Here, maps are defined *only* for time steps 1, 4 and 7. In this case,
LISFLOOD will use the map values of *pr000000.001* during time steps 1,
2 and 3, those of *pr000000.004* during time steps 4, 5 and 6, and those
of *pr000000.007* during time

steps 7, 8, 9 and 10. Since both regular and sparse stacks can be
combined within one single run, sparse stacks can be very useful to save
disk space. For instance, LISFLOOD always needs the *average daily*
temperature, even when the model is run on an hourly time step. So,
instead of defining 24 identical maps for each hour, you can simply
define 1 for the first hour of each day and leave out the rest, for
instance:

  **t **   **map name**

Similarly, potential evapo(transpi)ration is usually calculated on a
daily basis. So for hourly model runs it is often convenient to define
*E0*, *ES0* and *ET0* in sparse stacks as well. Leaf Area Index (*LAI*)
is a variable that changes relatively slowly over time, and as a result
it is usually advantageous to define *LAI* in a sparse map stack.

Leaf area index maps 
---------------------

Because Leaf area index maps follow a yearly circle, only a map stack of
one year is necessary which is then used again and again for the
following years (this approach can be used for all input maps following
a yearly circle e.g. water use). LAI is therefore defined as sparse map
stack with a map every 10 days or a month, for example for a monthly
changing LAI:

+--------+--------------+
| **t ** | **map name** |
+========+==============+
| 1      | lai00000.001 |
+--------+--------------+
| 2      | lai00000.032 |

|        |              |
| 12     | lai00000.335 |
+--------+--------------+

After one year the first map is taken again for simulation. For example
the simulation started on the 5^th^ March 2010 and the first LAI is
lai00000.060. On the 1^st^ March 2011 the map lai00000.060 is taken
again as LAI input. To let LISFLLOD know which map has to be used at
which day a lookup table (LaiOfDay.txt) is necessary.

Input tables
------------

In the previous version of LISFLOOD a number of model parameters are
read through tables that are linked to the classes on the land use and
soil (texture) maps. Those tables are replaced by maps (e.g. soil
hydraulic property maps) in order to include the sub-grid variability of
each parameter. Therefore only one table is used in the standard
LISFLOOD setting (without lake or reservoir option)

The following table gives an overview:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Organisation of input data
--------------------------

It is up to the user how the input data are organised. However, it is
advised to keep the base maps, meteorological maps and tables separated
(i.e. store them in separate directories). For practical reasons the
following input structure is suggested:

-   all base maps are in one directory (e.g. 'maps')

    -   fraction maps in a subfolder (e.g. 'fraction')

    -   soil hydraulic properties in a subfolder (e.g.'soilhyd')

    -   land cover depending maps in a subfolder (e.g.'table2map')

-   all tables are in one directory (e.g. 'tables')

-   all meteorological input maps are in one directory (e.g. 'meteo')

-   a folder Leaf Area Index (e.g. 'lai')

    -   all Leaf Area Index for forest in a subfolder (e.g.'forest')

    -   all Leaf Area Index for other in a subfolder (e.g.'other')

-   all output goes to one directory (e.g. 'out')

The following Figure illustrates this:

Generating input base maps
--------------------------

At the time of writing this document, complete sets of LISFLOOD base
maps covering the whole of Europe have been compiled at 1- and 5-km
pixel resolution. A number of automated procedures have been written
that allow you to generate sub-sets of these for pre-defined areas
(using either existing mask maps or co-ordinates of catchment outlets).

 5. LISFLOOD setup: the settings file
=====================================

In LISFLOOD, all file and parameter specifications are defined in a
settings file. The purpose of the settings file is to link variables and
parameters in the model to in- and output files (maps, time series,
tables) and numerical values. In addition, the settings file can be used
to specify several *options*. The settings file has a special (XML)
structure. In the next sections the general layout of the settings file
is explained. Although the file layout is not particularly complex, a
basic understanding of the general principles explained here is
essential for doing any successful model runs.

The settings file has an XML ('E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage')
structure. You can edit it using any text editor (e.g. Notepad, Editpad,
Emacs, vi). Alternatively, you can also use a dedicated XML editor such
as XMLSpy.

Layout of the settings file
---------------------------

A LISFLOOD settings file is made up of 4 elements, each of which has a
specific function. The general structure of the file is described using
XML-tags. XML stands for 'E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage', and
it is really nothing more than a way to describe data in a file. It
works by putting information that goes into a (text) file between tags,
and this makes it very easy add structure. For a LISFLOOD settings file,
the basic structure looks like this:

  **\<lfsettings\>**   Start of settings element
  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------
                       
  **\<lfuser\>**       Start of element with user-defined variables
                       
  **\</lfuser\>**      End of element with user-defined variables
                       
  **\<lfoptions\>**    Start of element with options
                       
  **\</lfoptions\>**   End of element with options
                       
  **\<lfbinding\>**    Start of element with 'binding' variables
                       
  **\</lfbinding\>**   End of element with 'binding' variables
                       
  **\<prolog\>**       Start of prolog
                       
  **\</prolog\>**      End of prolog
                       
  **\<lfsettings\>**   End of settings element

From this you can see the following things:

-   The settings file is made up of the elements 'lfuser', 'lfoptions'
    and 'lfbinding'; in addition, there is a 'prolog' element (but this
    will ultimately disappear in future LISFLOOD versions)

-   The start of each element is indicated by the element's name wrapped
    in square brackets, e.g. \<element\>

-   The end of each element is indicated by a forward slash followed by
    the element's name, all wrapped in square brackets, e.g.
    \</element\>

-   All elements are part of a 'root' element called '\<lfsettings\>'.

In brief, the main function of each element is:

  *lfuser*      : definition of paths to all in- and output files, and main model parameters (calibration + time-related)
  ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *lfbinding*   : definition of all individual in- and output files, and model parameters
  *lfoptions*   : switches to turn specific components of the model on or off

The following sections explain the function of each element in more
detail. This is mainly to illustrate the main concepts and how it all
fits together. A detailed description of all the variables that are
relevant for setting up and running LISFLOOD is given in Chapter 6.

### lfuser and and lfbinding elements

The 'lfbinding' element provides a very low-level way to define all
model parameter values as well as all in- and output maps, time series
and tables. The 'lfuser' element is used to define (user-defined) text
variables. These text variables can be used to substitute repeatedly
used expressions in the binding element. This greatly reduces the amount
of work that is needed to prepare the settings file. Each variable is
defined as a 'textvar' element within 'lfuser'/'lfbinding'. Each
'textvar' element has the attributes 'name' and 'value'. The following
example demonstrates the main principle (note that in the examples below
the prolog element is left out, but you will never need to edit this
anyway) :

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In the example two input files (maps) are defined. Both maps are in the
same directory. Instead of entering the full file path for every map, we
define a variable called *PathMaps* in the 'lfuser' element. This
variable can then be used in the 'lfbinding' element. Note that in the
'lfbinding' element you should always wrap user-defined variables in
brackets and add a leading dollar sign, e.g. *\$$(PathMaps)*. Since the
names of the in- and output files are usually the same for each model
run, the use of user-defined variables greatly simplifies setting up the
model for new catchments. In general, it is a good idea to use
user-defined variables for *everything* that needs to be changed on a
regular basis (paths to input maps, tables, meteorological data,
parameter values). This way you only have to deal with the variables in
the 'lfuser' element, without having to worry about anything in
'lfbinding' at all.

Now for a somewhat more realistic example:

From this example, note that *anything* can be defined with 'lfuser'
variables, whether it be paths, file prefixes or parameter value. At
first sight it might seem odd to define model parameter like
*UpperZoneTimeConstant* as a text variable when it is already defined in
the 'lfbinding' element. However, in practice it is much easier to have
all the important variables defined in the same element: in total the
model needs around 200 variables, parameters and file names. By
specifying each of those in the 'lfbinding' element you need to specify
each of them separately. Using the 'lfuser' variables this can be
reduced to about 50, which greatly simplifies things. You should think
of the 'lfbinding' element as a low-level way of describing the model
in- and output structure: anything can be changed and any file can be in
any given location, but the price to pay for this flexibility is that
the definition of the input structure will take a lot of work. By using
the 'lfuser' variables in a smart way, custom template settings files
can be created for specific model applications (calibration, scenario
modelling, operational flood forecasting). Typically, each of these
applications requires its own input structure, and you can use the
'lfuser' variables to define this structure. Also, note that the both
the *name* and *value* of each variable must be wrapped in (single or
double) quotes. Dedicated XML-editors like XmlSpy take care of this
automatically, so you won't usually have to worry about this.

**[NOTES:]{.underline}**

1.  It is important to remember that the *only* function of the 'lfuser'
    element is to *define* text variables; you can not *use* any of
    these text variables within the 'lfuser' element. For example, the
    following 'lfuser' element is *wrong* and *will not work*:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.  It *is* possible to define *everything* directly in the 'lfbinding'
    element without using any text variables at all! In that case the
    'lfuser' element can remain empty, even though it *has* to be
    present (i.e. \<lfuser\> \</lfuser\>). In general this is not
    recommended.

3.  Within the *lfuser* and *lfbinding* elements, model variables are
    organised into *groups*. This is just to make navigation in an xml
    editor easier.

### Variables in the lfbinding element

The variables that are defined in the 'lfbinding' element fall in either
of the following categories:

1.  **Single map**

> Example:
>
> \<textvar name=\"LandUse\" value=\"\$$(PathMaps)/landuse.map\"\>
>
> \<comment\>
>
> Land Use Classes
>
> \</comment\>
>
> \</textvar\>

2.  **Table**

> Example:
>
> \<textvar name=\"TabKSat1\" value=\"\$$(PathTables)/ksat1.txt\"\>
>
> \<comment\>
>
> Saturated conductivity \[cm/day\]
>
> \</comment\>
>
> \</textvar\>

3.  **Stack of maps**

> Example:
>
> \<textvar name=\"PrecipitationMaps\"
>
> value=\"\$$(PathMeteo)/\$$(PrefixPrecipitation)\"\>
>
> \<comment\>
>
> precipitation \[mm/day\]
>
> \</comment\>
>
> \</textvar\>

**[Note:]{.underline}**

> Taking -as an example- a prefix that equals "*pr*", the name of each
> map in the stack starts with "*pr*", and ends with the number of the
> time step. The name of each map is made up of a total of 11
> characters: 8 characters, a dot and a 3-character suffix. For
> instance:

  pr000000.007   : at time step 7
  -------------- ----------------------
  pr000035.260   : at time step 35260

> To avoid unexpected behaviour, do **not** use numbers in the prefix!
> For example:
>
> \<textvar name=\"PrecipitationMaps\"
>
> value=\"\$$(PathMeteo)/pr10 \"\>
>
> \<comment\>
>
> precipitation \[mm/day\]
>
> \</comment\>
>
> \</textvar\>
>
> For the first time step this yields the following file name:

  -------------- --
  pr100000.001   
  -------------- --

> But this is actually interpreted as time step 100,000,001!

4.  **Time series file**

> Example:

\<textvar name=\"DisTS\" value=\"\$$(PathOut)/dis.tss\"\>

\<comment\>

Reported discharge \[cu m/s\]

\</comment\>

\</textvar\>

5.  **Single parameter value**

> Example:
>
> \<textvar name=\"UpperZoneTimeConstant\"
> value=\"\$$(UpperZoneTimeConstant)\"\>
>
> \<comment\>
>
> Time constant for water in upper zone \[days\]
>
> \</comment\>
>
> \</textvar\>

### Variables in the lfuser element

As said before the variables in the 'lfuser' elements are all text
variables, and they are used simply to substitute text in the
'lfbinding' element. In practice it is sometimes convenient to use the
same name for a text variable that is defined in the 'lfuser' element
and a 'lfbinding' variable. For example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **\<lfuser\>**                                                        |
|                                                                       |
| \<textvar name=\"UpperZoneTimeConstant\" value=\"10\"\>               |
|                                                                       |
| \<comment\>                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Time constant for water in upper zone \[days\]                        |
|                                                                       |
| \</comment\>                                                          |
|                                                                       |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In this case 'UpperZoneTimeConstant' in the 'lfuser' element (just a
text variable) is something different from 'UpperZoneTimeConstant' in
the 'lfbinding' element!

### 

### lfoption element

The 'lfoption' element effectively allows you to switch certain parts of
the model on or off. Within LISFLOOD, there are two categories of
options:

1.  Options to activate the reporting of additional output maps and time
    series (e.g. soil moisture maps)

2.  Options that activate special LISFLOOD features, such as inflow
    hydrographs and the simulation of reservoirs

### Viewing available options

You can view all options by running LISFLOOD with the *\--listoptions*
flag. For each option, the following information is listed:

OptionName Choices DefaultValue

'OptionName' -as you might have guessed already- simply is the name of
the option. 'Choices' indicates the possible values of the option, and
'DefaultValue' describes the default behaviour. For instance, if you
look at the reservoir option:

simulateReservoirs choices=(1,0) default=0

you see that the value of this option is either 0 (off) or 1 (on), and
that the default value is 0 (off, i.e. do not simulate any reservoirs).

The information on the reporting options is a little bit different (and
slightly confusing). Looking at the option for reporting discharge maps:

repDischargeMaps choices=(1) noDefault

By default, discharge maps are not reported, so you would expect
something like "default=0". However, due to the way options are defined
internally in the model, in this case we have no default value, which
means it is switched off.[^4] Report options that are switched *on* by
default look like this:

repStateMaps choices=(1) default=1

To minimise the confusion, you should:

1.  Ignore the "Choices" item

2.  Interpret "noDefault" as "default=0"

This is all a bit confusing, and the displaying of option information
may well change in future LISFLOOD versions.

### Defining options

Within the 'lfoptions' element of the settings file, each option is
defined using a 'setoption' element, which has the attributes 'name' and
'choice' (i.e. the actual value). For example:

+----------------------------------------------+
| **\<lfoptions\>**                            |
|                                              |
| \<setoption choice=\"1\" name=\"inflow\" /\> |
|                                              |
| **\</lfoptions\>**                           |
+----------------------------------------------+

You are not obliged to use any options: if you leave the 'lfoptions'
element empty, LISFLOOD will simply run using the default values (i.e.
run model without optional modules; only report most basic output
files). However, the 'lfoptions' element itself (i.e. \<lfoptions\>
\</lfoptions\>) *has* to be present, even if empty!

6. Preparing the settings file
==============================

This chapter describes how to prepare your own settings file. Instead of
writing the settings file completely from scratch, we suggest to use the
settings template that is provided with LISFLOOD as a starting point. In
order to use the template, you should make sure the following
requirements are met:

-   All input maps and tables are named according to default file names
    (see Chapter 4 and Annex 12)

-   All base maps are in the right directories

-   All tables are in one directory

-   All meteo input is in one directory

-   All Leaf Area Index input is in the right directories

-   An (empty) directory where all model data can be written exists

If this is all true, the settings file can be prepared very quickly by
editing the items in the 'lfuser' element. The following is a detailed
description of the different sections of the 'lfuser' element. The
present LISFLOOD version contains process-related parameters (not taking
into account the parameters that are defined through the maps). These
are all defined in the 'lfuser' element, and default values are given
for each of them. Even though *any* of these parameters can be treated
as calibration constants, doing so for *all* of them would lead to
serious over-parameterisation problems. In the description of these
parameters we will therefore provide some suggestions as to which
parameters should be used for calibration, and which one are better left
untouched.

Time-related constants
----------------------

The 'lfuser' section starts with a number of constants that are related
to the simulation period and the time interval used. These are all
defined as single values.

Parameters related to evapo(transpi)ration and interception
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following parameters are all related to the simulation of
evapo(transpi)ration and rainfall interception. Although they can all be
defined as either a single value or as a map, we recommend using the
single values that are included in the template. We do not recommend
using any of these parameters as calibration constants.

Parameters related to snow and frost
------------------------------------

The following parameters are all related to the simulation of snow
accumulation, snowmelt and frost. All these parameters can be defined as
either single values or maps. We recommend to start out by leaving them
all at their default values. If prior data suggest major under- or
overcatch problems in the observed snowfall, *SnowFactor* can be
adjusted accordingly. *SnowMeltCoef* may be used as a calibration
constant, but since snow observations are typically associated with
large uncertainty bands, the calibration may effectively just be
compensating for these input errors.

Infiltration parameters 
------------------------

The following two parameters control the simulation of infiltration and
preferential flow. Both are empirical parameters that are treated as
calibration constants, and both can be defined as single values or maps.

Groundwater parameters 
-----------------------

The following parameters control the simulation shallow and deeper
groundwater. *GwLossFraction* should be kept at 0 unless prior
information clearly indicates that groundwater is lost beyond the
catchment boundaries (or to deep groundwater systems). The other
parameters are treated as calibration constants. All these parameters
can be defined as single values or maps.

Routing parameters 
-------------------

These parameters are all related to the routing of water in the channels
as well as the routing of surface runoff. The multiplier *CalChanMan*
can be used to fine-tune the timing of the channel routing, and it may
be defined as either a single value or a map. All other parameters
should be kept at their default values.

Parameters related to numerics
------------------------------

This category only contains one parameter at the moment, which can only
be a single value. We strongly recommend keeping this parameter at its
default value.

> *CourantCrit* (*C~crit~* in Eq 2-36) is the critical Courant number
> which controls the numerical accuracy of the simulated soil moisture
> fluxes \[-\]. Any value between 0 and 1 can be used, but using values
> that are too high can lead to unrealistic "jumps" in the simulated
> soil moisture, whereas very low values result in reduced computational
> performance (because many iterations will be necessary to obtain the
> required accuracy). Values above 1 should never be used, as they will

> iterations.

File paths
----------

Here you can specify where all the input files are located, and where
output should be written. Note that you can use both forward and
backward slashes on both Windows and Linux-based systems without any
problem (when LISFLOOD reads the settings file it automatically formats
these paths according to the conventions used by the operating system
used). The default settings template contains relative paths, which in
most cases allows you to run the model directly without changing these
settings (assuming that you execute LISFLOOD from the root directory of
your catchment).

Prefixes of meteo and vegetation related variables
--------------------------------------------------

Here you can define the prefix that is used for each meteorological
variable (and LAI and water use).

Initial conditions
------------------

As with the calibration parameters you can use both maps and single
values to define the catchment conditions at the start of a simulation.
Note that a couple of variables can be initialized internally in the
model (explained below). Also, be aware that the initial conditions
define the state of the model at *t=(StepStart -1)*. As long as
*StepStart* equals 1 this corresponds to *t=0*, but for larger values of
*StepStart* this is (obviously) not the case!

Running the model
-----------------

To run the model, start up a command prompt (Windows) or a console
window (Linux) and type 'lisflood' followed by the name of the settings
file, e.g.:

lisflood settings.xml

If everything goes well you should see something like this:

Using options
-------------

As explained in Chapter 5, the 'lfoptions' element gives you additional
control over what LISFLOOD is doing. Using options it is possible to
switch certain parts of the model on or off. This way you can tell the
model exactly which output files are reported and which ones aren't.
Also, they can be used to activate a number of additional model
features, such as the simulation of reservoirs and inflow hydrographs.

The table in Annex 11 lists all currently implemented options and their
corresponding defaults. All currently implemented options are switches
(1= on, 0=off). You can set as many options as you want (or none at
all). Annex 11 lists all currently implemented options. Note that each
option generally requires additional items in the settings file. For
instance, using the inflow hydrograph option requires an input map and
time series, which have to be specified in the settings file. If you
want to report discharge maps at each time step, you will first have to
specify under which name they will be written. The template settings
file that is provided with LISFLOOD always contains file definitions for
all optional output maps and time series. The use of the *output*
options is described in detail in Chapter 8.

Within the 'lfoptions' element of the settings file, each option is
defined using a 'setoption' element, which has the attributes 'name' and
'choice' (i.e. the actual value). For example:

+----------------------------------------------+
| **\<lfoptions\>**                            |

 7. Initialisation of LISFLOOD
==============================

Introduction
------------

Just as any other hydrological model, LISFLOOD needs to have some
estimate of the initial state (i.e. amount of water stored) of its
internal state variables. Two situations can occur:

1.  The initial state of all state variables is known (for example, the
    "end maps" of a daily water balance run are used to define the
    initial conditions of an hourly flood-event run)

2.  The initial state of all state variables is unknown

The second situation is the most common one, and this chapter presents
an in-depth look at the initialisation of LISFLOOD. First the effect of
the model's initial state on the results of a simulation is demonstrated
using a simple example. Then, LISFLOOD's various initialisation options
are discussed. Most of this chapter focuses on the initialisation of the
lower groundwater zone, as this is the model storage component that is
the most difficult to in initialise.

An example
----------

To better understand the impact of the initial model state on simulation
results, let's start with a simple example. Figure 7.1 shows 3 LISFLOOD
simulations of soil moisture for the upper soil layer. In the first
simulation, it was assumed that the soil is initially completely
saturated. In the second one, the soil was assumed to be completely dry
(i.e. at residual moisture content). Finally, a third simulation was
done where the initial soil moisture content was assumed to be in
between these two extremes.

height="3.6979166666666665in"}

***Figure 7.1** Simulation of soil moisture in upper soil layer for a
soil that is initially at saturation (s), at residual moisture content
(r) and in between (\[s+r\]/2) *

What is clear from the Figure is that the initial amount of moisture in
the soil only has a marked effect on the start of each simulation; after
a couple of months the three curves converge. In other words, the
"memory" of the upper soil layer only goes back a couple of months (or,
more precisely, for time lags of more than about 8 months the
autocorrelation in time is negligible).

In theory, this behaviour provides a convenient and simple way to
initialise a model such as LISFLOOD. Suppose we want to do a simulation
of the year 1995. We obviously don't know the state of the soil at the
beginning of that year. However, we can get around this by starting the
simulation a bit earlier than 1995, say one year. In that case we use
the year 1994 as a *warm-up* period, assuming that by the start of 1995
the influence of the initial conditions (i.e. 1-1-1994) is negligible.
The very same technique can be applied to initialise LISFLOOD's other
state variables, such as the amounts of water in the lower soil layer,
the upper groundwater zone, the lower groundwater zone, and in the
channel.

Setting up a LISFLOOD run (cold start)
--------------------------------------

When setting up a model run that includes a warm-up period, most of the
internal state variables can be simply set to 0 at the start of the run.
This applies to the initial amount of water on the soil surface
(*WaterDepthInitValue*), snow cover (*SnowCoverInitValue*), frost index
(*FrostIndexInitValue*), interception storage (*CumIntInitValue*), and
storage in the upper groundwater zone (*UZInitValue*). The initial value
of the 'days since last rainfall event' (*DSLRInitValue*) is typically
set to 1.

For the remaining state variables, initialisation is somewhat less
straightforward. The amount of water in the channel (defined by
*TotalCrossSectionAreaInitValue*) is highly spatially variable (and
limited by the channel geometry). The amount of water that can be stored
in the upper and lower soil layers (*ThetaInit1Value*,
*ThetaInit2Value*) is limited by the soil's porosity. The lower
groundwater zone poses special problems because of its overall slow
response (discussed in a separate section below). Because of this,
LISFLOOD provides the possibility to initialise these variables
internally, and these special initialisation methods can be activated by
setting the initial values of each of these variables to a special
'bogus' value of *-9999*. Table 7.1 summarises these special
initialisation methods:

| methods are activated |
| by setting the value  |

| variable to a 'bogus' |

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Note that the "-9999" 'bogus' value can *only* be used with the
variables in Table 7.1; for all other variables they will produce
nonsense results! The initialisation of the lower groundwater zone will
be discussed in the next sections.

Initialisation of the lower groundwater zone
--------------------------------------------

Even though the use of a sufficiently long warm-up period usually
results in a correct initialisation, a complicating factor is that the
time needed to initialise any storage component of the model is
dependent on the average residence time of the water in it. For example,
the moisture content of the upper soil layer tends to respond almost
instantly to LISFLOOD's meteorological forcing variables (precipitation,
evapo(transpi)ration). As a result, relatively short warm-up periods are
sufficient to initialise this storage component. At the other extreme,
the response of the lower groundwater zone is generally very slow
(especially for large values of *T~lz~*). Consequently, to avoid
unrealistic trends in the simulations, very long warm-up periods may be
needed. Figure 7.2 shows a typical example for an 8-year simulation, in
which a decreasing trend in the lower groundwater zone is visible
throughout the whole simulation period. Because the amount of water in
the lower zone is directly proportional to the baseflow in the channel,
this will obviously lead to an unrealistic long-term simulation of
baseflow. Assuming the long-term climatic input is more or less
constant, the baseflow (and thus the storage in the lower zone) should
be free of any long-term trends (although some seasonal variation is
normal). In order to avoid the need for excessive warm-up periods,
LISFLOOD is capable of calculating a 'steady-state' storage amount for
the lower groundwater zone. This *steady state* storage is very
effective for reducing the lower zone's warm-up time. In the next
sections the concept of *steady state* is first explained, and it is
shown how it can be used to speed up the initialisation of a LISFLOOD
run.

***Figure 7.2** 8-year simulation of lower zone storage. Note how the
influence of the initial storage persists throughout the simulation
period. *

Lower groundwater zone: steady state storage
--------------------------------------------

The response of the lower groundwater zone is defined by two simple
equations. First, we have the inflow into the lower zone, which occurs
at the following rate \[mm day^-1^\]:

\$${D\_{uz,lz}} = \\min (G{W\_{perc}},\\;UZ/\\Delta t)\$$ (7-1)

Here, *GW~perc~* \[mm day^-1^\] is a user-defined value (calibration
constant), and *UZ* is the amount of water available in the upper
groundwater zone \[mm\]. The rate of flow out of the lower zone \[mm
day^-1^\] equals:

\$${Q\_{lz}} = \\frac{1}{{{{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{lz}}}}}} \\cdot LZ\$$ (7-2)

where *T~lz~* is a reservoir constant \[days\], and *LZ* is the amount
of water that is stored in the lower zone \[mm\].

Now, let's do a simple numerical experiment: assuming that *D~uz,lz~* is
a constant value, we can take some arbitrary initial value for *LZ* and
then simulate (e.g. in a spreadsheet) the development over *LZ* over
time. Figure 7.3 shows the results of 2 such experiments. In the upper
Figure, we start with a very high initial storage (1500 mm). The inflow
rate is fairly small (0.2 mm/day), and *T~lz~* is quite small as well
(which means a relatively short residence time of the water in the lower
zone). What is interesting here is that, over time, the storage evolves
asymptotically towards a constant state. In the lower Figure, we start
with a much smaller initial storage (50 mm), but the inflow rate is much
higher here (1.5 mm/day) and so is *T~lz~* (1000 days). Here we see an
upward trend, again towards a constant value. However, in this case the
constant 'end' value is not reached within the simulation period, which
is mainly because *T~lz~* is set to a value for which the response is
very slow.

At this point it should be clear that what you see in these graphs is
exactly the same behaviour that is also apparent in the 'real' LISFLOOD
simulation in Figure 7.2. Being able to know the 'end' storages in
Figure 7.3 in advance would be very helpful, because it would eliminate
any trends. As it happens, this can be done very easily from the model
equations. A storage that is constant over time means that the in- and
outflow terms balance each other out. This is known as a *steady state*
situation, and the constant 'end' storage is in fact the *steady state
storage*. The rate of change of the lower zone's storage at any moment
is given by the continuity equation:

\$$\\frac{{dLZ}}{{dt}} = I(t) - O(t)\$$ (7-3)

where *I* is the (time dependent) inflow (i.e. groundwater recharge) and
*O* is the outflow rate. For a situation where the storage remains
constant, we can write:

\$$\\frac{{dLZ}}{{dt}} = 0\\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad I(t) - O(t) =
0\$$ (7-4)

![](media/media/image39.emf){width="5.447916666666667in"
height="7.40625in"}

***Figure 7.3** Two 10-year simulations of lower zone storage with
constant inflow. Upper Figure: high initial storage, storage approaches
steady-state storage (dashed) after about 1500 days. Lower Figure: low
initial storage, storage doesn't reach steady-state within 10 years.*

This equation can be re-written as:

\$$I(t) - \\frac{1}{{{{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{lz}}}}}} \\cdot LZ = 0\$$ (7-5)

Solving this for *LZ* gives the steady state storage:

\$$L{Z\_{ss}} = {{\\rm{T}}\_{{\\rm{lz}}}} \\cdot I(t)\$$ (7-6)

We can check this for our numerical examples:

  *T~lz~*   *I*   *LZ~ss~*
  --------- ----- ----------
  250       0.2   50
  1000      1.5   1500

which corresponds exactly to the results of Figure 7.3.

Steady-state storage in practice
--------------------------------

An actual LISFLOOD simulation differs from the previous example in 2
ways. First, in any real simulation the inflow into the lower zone is
not constant, but varies in time. This is not really a problem, since
*LZ~ss~* can be computed from the *average* recharge. However, this is
something we do not know until the end of the simulation! Also, the
inflow into the lower zone is controlled by the availability of water in
the upper zone, which, in turn, depends on the supply of water from the
soil. Hence, it is influenced by any calibration parameters that control
behaviour of soil- and subsoil (e.g. *T~uz~*, *GW~perc~*, *b*, and so
on). This means that --when calibrating the model- the average recharge
will be different for every parameter set. Note, however, that it will
*always* be smaller than the value of *GW~perc~*, which is used as an
upper limit in the model.. Note that the pre-run procedures include a
sufficiently long warm-up period.

### 

### Use pre-run to calculate average recharge

Here, we first do a "pre-run" that is used to calculate the average
inflow into the lower zone. This average inflow can be reported as a
map, which is then used in the actual run. This involves the following
steps:

1.  Set all the initial conditions to either 0,1 or -9999

2.  Activate the "InitLisflood" option by setting it active in the
    'lfoptions' in the settings file:

> \<setoption choice=\"1\" name=\"InitLisflood\"/\>

3.  Run the model for a longer period (if possible more than 3 years,
    best for the whole modelling period)

4.  Go back to the LISFLOOD settings file, and set the InitLisflood
    inactive:

> \<setoption choice=\"0\" name=\"InitLisflood\"/\>

5.  Run the model again using the modified settings file

In this case, the initial state of *LZ* is computed for the correct
average inflow, and the simulated storage in the lower zone throughout
the simulation shouldl not show any systematic (long-term) trends. The
obvious price to pay for this is that the pre-run increase the
computational load. However the pre-run will use a simplified routing to
decrease the computational run-time. As long as the simulation period
for the actual run and the pre-run are identical, the procedure gives a
100% guarantee that the development of the lower zone storage will be
free of any systematic bias. Since the computed recharge values are
dependent on the model parameterisation used, in a calibration setting
the whole procedure must be repeated for each parameter set!

### Checking the lower zone initialisation 

The presence of any initialisation problems of the lower zone can be
checked by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element of the
settings file:

> \<setoption name=\" repStateUpsGauges\" choice=\"1\"\>\</setoption\>

This tells the model to write the values of all state variables
(averages, upstream of contributing area to each gauge) to time series
files. The default name of the lower zone time series is 'lzUps.tss'.
Figure 7.4 shows an example of an 8-year simulation that was done both
without (dashed line) and with a pre-run. The simulation without the
pre-run shows a steady decreasing trend throughout the 8-year period,
whereas the simulation for which the pre-run was used doesn't show this
long-term trend (although in this specific case a modest increasing
trend is visible throughout the first 6 years of the simulation, but
this is related to trends in the meteorological input).

without using a pre-run. Note the strong decreasing trend in the
simulation without pre-run. *

Using a previous run (warm start)
---------------------------------

At the end of each model run, LISFLOOD writes maps of all internal state
variables at the last time step. You can use these maps as the initial
conditions for a succeeding simulation. This is particularly useful if
you are simulating individual flood events on a small time interval
(e.g. hourly). For instance, to estimate the initial conditions just
before the flood you can do a 'pre-run' on a *daily* time interval for
the year before the flood. You can then use the 'end maps' as the
initial conditions for the hourly simulation.

In any case, you should be aware that values of some internal state
variables of the model (especially lower zone storage) are very much
dependent on the parameterisation used. Hence, suppose we have 'end
maps' that were created using some parameterisation of the model (let's
say parameter set *A*), then these maps should *not* be used as initial
conditions for a model run with another parameterisation (parameter set
*B*). If you decide to do this anyway, you are likely to encounter
serious initialisation problems (but these may not be immediately
visible in the output!). If you do this while calibrating the model
(i.e. parameter set *B* is the calibration set), this will render the
calibration exercise pretty much useless (since the output is the result
of a mix of different parameter sets). However, for
*FrostIndexInitValue* and *DSLRInitValue* it is perfectly safe to use
the 'end maps', since the values of these maps do not depend on any
calibration parameters (that is, only if you do not calibrate on any of
the frost-related parameters!). If you need to calibrate for individual
events (i.e.hourly), you should apply *each* parameterisation on *both*
the (daily) pre-run and the 'event' run! This may seem awkward, but
there is no way of getting around this (except from avoiding event-based
calibration at all, which may be a good idea anyway).

Summary of LISFLOOD initialisation procedure
--------------------------------------------

From the foregoing it is clear that the initialisation of LISFLOOD can
be done in a number of ways. Figure 7.5 gives an overview. As already
stated in the introduction section, any LISFLOOD simulation will fall
into either of the following two categories:

1.  The initial state of all state variables is known and defined by the
    end state of a previous run. In this case you can use the 'end' maps
    of the previous run's state variables as the initial conditions of
    you current run. Note that this requires that both simulations are
    run using exactly the same parameter set! Mixing parameter sets here
    will introduce unwanted artefacts into your simulation results.

2.  The initial state of all state variables is unknown. In this case
    > you should run the model with a sufficient pre-run (if possible
    > more than 3 years, best for the whole modelling period) and
    > InitLisflood=1. The average recharge map that is generated from
    > the pre-run can subsequently be used as the average lower zone
    > inflow estimate (*LZAvInflowEstimate*) in the actual simulation,
    > which will avoid any initialisation problems of the lower
    > groundwater zone

3.  Is it possible not to use the first year for further analysis of
    > results, because this is the "warm-up" period for all the other
    > variables like snow, vegetation, soil (see e.g. figure 7.1 for
    > soil moisture)?\
    > Then leave or set all the initial conditions to either 0,1 or
    > -9999 and run the model with InitLisflood=0

4.  If you want to include the first year of modelling into your
    analysis, you have to do a "warm-up" run (one year will usually do)
    to initialize all the initial conditions. You have to set option
    repEndMaps=1 to report end maps. Best possible solution is to use
    the year before the actual modelling period. Second best is to use
    any one year period to set up the initial conditions. After that you
    will have the 'end' maps and you can proceed with 1. again

 8. Output generated by LISFLOOD
================================

Default LISFLOOD output
-----------------------

LISFLOOD can generate a wide variety of output. Output is generated as
either maps or time series (PCRaster format, which can be visualised
with PCRaster's 'aguila' application). Reporting of output files can be
switched on and off using options in the LISFLOOD settings file. Also, a
number of output files are specific to other optional modules, such as
the simulation of reservoirs. The following table lists all the output
time series that are reported by default (note that the file names can
always be changed by the user, although this is not recommended):

To speed up the pre-run and to prevent that results are taken from the
pre-run, all additional output is disabled if option 'InitLisflood' = 1
is chosen. With 'InitLisflood' = 1 the output is limited to *dis.tss,
lzavin.map, lzavin\_forest.map* and some other initial maps if
additional option like e.g. the double kinematic wave is chosen.

In addition to these time series, by default LISFLOOD reports maps of
all state variables at the last timestep of a simulation[^5]. These maps
can be used to define the initial conditions of a succeeding simulation.
For instance, you can do a 1-year simulation on a daily time step, and
use the 'end maps' of this simulation to simulate a flood event using an
hourly time step. Table 8.2 and Annex 13 list all these maps. Note that
some state variables are valid for the whole pixel, whereas others are
only valid for a sub-domain of each pixel. This is indicated in the last
column of the table.

Additional output
-----------------

Apart from the default output, the model can --optionally- generate some
additional time series and maps. Roughly this additional output falls in
either of the following categories:

**Time series**

1.  Time series with values of model state variables at user-defined
    locations (sites); reporting of these time series can be activated
    using the option *repStateSites=1.* Note that 'sites' can be either
    individual pixels or larger areas (e.g. catchments, administrative
    areas, and so on). In case of larger areas the model reports the
    average value for each respective area.

2.  Time series with values of model rate variables at user-defined
    locations (sites); reporting of these time series can be activated
    using the option *repRateSites=1*

3.  Time series with values of meteorological input variables, averaged
    over the area upstream of each gauge location; reporting of these
    time series can be activated using the option *repMeteoUpsGauges=1*

4.  Time series with values of model state variables, averaged over area
    upstream of each gauge location; reporting of these time series can
    be activated using the option *repStateUpsGauges=1*

5.  Time series with values of model rate variables, averaged over area
    upstream of each gauge location; reporting of these time series can
    be activated using the option *repRateUpsGauges=1*

6.  Time series that are specific to other options (e.g. simulation of
    reservoirs).

**Maps**

1.  Maps of discharge at each time step; reporting of these maps can be
    activated using the option *repDischargeMaps=1*

2.  Maps with values of driving meteorological values at each time step

3.  Maps with values of model rate variables at each time step

4.  Maps that are specific to other options (e.g. simulation of
    reservoirs).

In addition, some additional maps and time series may be reported for
debugging purposes. In general these are not of any interest to the
LISFLOOD user, so they remain undocumented here.

Note that the options *repStateUpsGauges*, *repRateUpsGauges* and
*repDischargeMaps* tend to slow down the execution of the model quite
dramatically. For applications of the model where performance is
critical (e.g. automated calibration runs), we advise to keep them
switched off, if possible. The additional time series are listed in the
Annex 13. Note again the domains for which variables are valid: all
*rate variables* are reported as pixel-average values. Soil moisture and
groundwater storage are reported for the permeable fraction of each
pixel only. The reported snow cover is the average of the snow depths in
snow zones A, B and C.

By default, the names of the reported discharge maps start with the
prefix '*dis*' and end with the time step number (the naming conventions
are identical to the ones used for the input maps with meteorological
variables, which is explained in Chapter 4). Annex 13 summarises all
options to report additional output maps. The previous remarks related
to the domains for which the state variable values are valid also apply
to the maps listed in Annex 13.

Annex 1: Simulation of reservoirs
=================================

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD reservoirs routine, and how it is
used. The simulation of reservoirs is *optional*, and it can be
activated by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulateReservoirs\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Reservoirs can be simulated on channel pixels where kinematic wave
routing is used. The routine does *not* work for channel stretches where
the dynamic wave is used!

Description of the reservoir routine 
-------------------------------------

Reservoirs are simulated as points in the channel network. The inflow
into each reservoir equals the channel flow upstream of the reservoir.
The outflow behaviour is described by a number of parameters. First,
each reservoir has a total storage capacity *S* \[m^3^\]. The relative
filling of a reservoir, *F*, is a fraction between 0 and 1. There are
three 'special' filling levels. First, each reservoir has a 'dead
storage' fraction, since reservoirs never empty completely. The
corresponding filling fraction is the 'conservative storage limit',
*L~c~*. For safety reasons a reservoir is never filled to the full
storage capacity. The 'flood storage limit' (*L~f~*) represents this
maximum allowed storage fraction. The buffering capacity of a reservoir
is the storage available between the 'flood storage limit' and the
'normal storage limit' (*L~n~*). Three additional parameters define the
way the outflow of a reservoir is regulated. For e.g. ecological reasons
each reservoir has a 'minimum outflow' (*O~min~*, \[m^3^ s^-1^\]). For
high discharge situations, the 'non-damaging outflow' (*O~nd~*, \[m^3^
s^-1^\]) is the maximum possible outflow that will not cause problems
downstream. The 'normal outflow' (*O~norm~*, \[m^3^ s^-1^\]) is valid
once the reservoir reaches its 'normal storage' filling level.

Depending on the relative filling of the reservoir, outflow (*O~res~*,
\[m^3^ s^-1^\]) is calculated as:

\$${O\_{res}} = \\min ({O\_{\\min }},\\frac{1}{{\\Delta t}}{\\kern 1pt} F
\\cdot S) & & & & & F \\le 2{L\_c}\$$

with:

  S         : Reservoir storage capacity \[m^3^\]
  --------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  F         : Reservoir fill (fraction, 1 at total storage capacity) \[-\]
  L~c~      : Conservative storage limit \[-\]
  L~n~      : Normal storage limit \[-\]
  L~f~      : Flood storage limit \[-\]
  O~min~    : Minimum outflow \[m^3^ s^-1^\]
  O~norm~   : Normal outflow \[m^3^ s^-1^\]
  O~nd~     : Non-damaging outflow \[m^3^ s^-1^\]
  I~res~    : Reservoir inflow \[m^3^ s^-1^\]

In order to prevent numerical problems, the reservoir outflow is
calculated using a user-defined time interval (or *Δt*, if it is smaller
than this value).

Preparation of input data 
--------------------------

For the simulation of reservoirs a number of addition input files are
necessary. First, the locations of the reservoirs are defined on a
(nominal) map called '*res.map*'. It is important that all reservoirs
are located on a channel pixel (you can verify this by displaying the
reservoirs map on top of the channel map). Also, since each reservoir
receives its inflow from its upstream neighbouring channel pixel, you
may want to check if each reservoir has any upstream channel pixels at
all (if not, the reservoir will gradually empty during a model run!).
The management of the reservoirs is described by 7 tables. The following
table lists all required input:

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

When you create the map with the reservoir sites, pay special attention
to the following: if a reservoir is on the most downstream cell (i.e.
the outflow point, see Figure A1.1), the reservoir routine may produce
erroneous output. In particular, the mass balance errors cannot be
calculated correctly in that case. The same applies if you simulate only
a sub-catchment of a larger map (by selecting the subcatchment in the
mask map). This situation can usually be avoided by extending the mask
map by one cell in downstream direction.

*Figure A1.1 Placement of the reservoirs: reservoirs on the outflow
point (left) result in erroneous behavior of the reservoir routine.*

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

All in- and output files need to be defined in the settings file. If you
are using a default LISFLOOD settings template, all file definitions are
already defined in the 'lfbinding' element. Just make sure that the map
with the reservoir locations is in the "maps" directory, and all tables
in the 'tables" directory. If this is the case, you only have to specify
the time-step used for the reservoir calculations and the initial
reservoir filling level (expressed as a fraction of the storage
capacity). Both are defined in the 'lfuser' element of the settings
file. For the reservoir time step (*DtSecReservoirs*) it is recommended
to start with a value of 14400 (4 hours), and try smaller values if the
simulated reservoir outflow shows large oscillations.
*ReservoirInitialFillValue* can be either a map or a value (between 0
and 1). So we add this to the 'lfuser' element (if it is not there
already):

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The value -9999 tells the model to set the initial reservoir fill to the
normal storage limit. Note that this value is completely arbitrary.
However, if no other information is available this may be a reasonable
starting point.

Finally, you have to tell LISFLOOD that you want to simulate reservoirs!
To do this, add the following statement to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulateReservoirs\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Now you are ready to run the model. If you want to compare the model
results both with and without the inclusion of reservoirs, you can
switch off the simulation of reservoirs either by:

1.  Removing the 'simulateReservoirs' statement from the 'lfoptions
    element, or

2.  changing it into \<setoption name=\"simulateReservoirs\"
    choice=\"0\" /\>

Both have exactly the same effect. You don't need to change anything in
either 'lfuser' or 'lfbinding'; all file definitions here are simply
ignored during the execution of the model.

Reservoir output files

The reservoir routine produces 3 additional time series and one map, as
listed in the following table:

step to define the initial conditions of a succeeding simulation, e.g.:

Annex 2: Polder option 
=======================

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD polder routine, and how it is used.
The simulation of polders is *optional*, and it can be activated by
adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulatePolders\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Polders can be simulated on channel pixels where dynamic wave routing is
used. The routine does *not* work for channel stretches where the
kinematic wave is used!

Description of the polder routine 
----------------------------------

Polders are simulated as points in the channel network. The polder
routine is adapted from Förster et. al (2004), and based on the weir
equation of Poleni (Bollrich & Preißler, 1992). The flow rates from the
channel to the polder area and vice versa are calculated by balancing
out the water levels in the channel and in the polder, as shown in
Figure A2.1.

![polders](media/media/image43.png){width="5.770833333333333in"
height="1.9166666666666667in"}

*Figure A2.1 Schematic overview of the simulation of polders.* pb *is
the polder bottom level (above the channel bottom);* w~c~ *is the water
level in the channel;* h~c~ *and* h~p~ *are the water levels above the
polder in- / outflow, respectively*

From the Figure, it is easy to see that there can be three situations:

1.  ***h~c~* \> *h~p~***: water flows out of the channel, into the
    polder. The flow rate, *q~c,p~*, is calculated using:

> where *b* is the outflow width \[m\], *g* is the acceleration due to
> gravity (9.81 m s^-2^) and *μ* is a weir constant which has a value of
> 0.49. Furthermore *q~c,p~* is in \[m^3^ s^-1^\].

2.  ***h~c~* \< *h~p~***: water flows out of the polder back into the
    channel. The flow rate, *q~p,c~*, is now calculated using:
(A2.2)

3.  ***h~c~* = *h~p~***: no water flowing into either direction (note
    here that the minimum value of *h~c~* is zero). In this case both
    *q~c,p~* and *q~p,c~* are zero.

Regulated and unregulated polders
---------------------------------

The above equations are valid for *unregulated* polders. It is also
possible to simulated *regulated* polders, which is illustrated in
Figure A2.2. Regulated polders are opened at a user-defined time
(typically during the rising limb of a flood peak). The polder closes
automatically once it is full. Subsequently, the polder is opened again
to release the stored water back into the channel, which also occurs at
a user-defined time. The opening- and release times for each polder are
defined in two lookup tables (see Table 2.1). In order to simulate the
polders in *unregulated* mode these times should both be set to a bogus
value of -9999. *Only* if *both* opening- and release time are set to
some other value, LISFLOOD will simulate a polder in regulated mode.
Since LISFLOOD only supports *one* single regulated open-close-release
cycle per simulation, you should use regulated mode *only* for single
flood events. For continuous simulations (e.g. long-tem waterbalance
runs) you should only run the polders in unregulated mode.

![poldersRegulated](media/media/image44.png){width="5.395833333333333in"
height="3.3958333333333335in"}

*Figure A2.2 Simulation of a regulated polder. Polder is closed
(inactive) until user-defined opening time, after which it fills up to
its capacity (flow rate according to Eq A2.1). Water stays in polder
until user-defined release time, after which water is released back to
the channel (flow rate according to Eq A2.2). *

Preparation of input data 
--------------------------

The locations of the reservoirs are defined on a (nominal) map called
'*polders.map*'. Any polders that are *not* on a channel pixel are
ignored by LISFLOOD, so you may want to check the polder locations
before running the model (you can do this by displaying the reservoirs
map on top of the channel map). The current implementation of the polder
routine may result in numerical instabilities for kinematic wave pixels,
so for the moment it is recommended to define polders *only* on channels
where the dynamic wave is used. Furthermore, the properties of each
polder are described using a number of tables. All required input is
listed in the following table:

step* numbers (*not* days or hours!!). For *unregulated* polders, set
both parameters to a bogus value of -9999, i.e.:

|          |
| 15 -9999 |

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

All in- and output files need to be defined in the settings file. If you
are using a default LISFLOOD settings template, all file definitions are
already defined in the 'lfbinding' element. Just make sure that the map
with the polder locations is in the "maps" directory, and all tables in
the 'tables" directory. If this is the case, you only have to specify
the initial reservoir water level in the polders.
*PolderInitialLevelValue* is defined in the 'lfuser' element of the
settings file, and it can be either a map or a value. The value of the
weir constant *μ* is also defined here, although you should not change
its default value. So we add this to the 'lfuser' element (if it is not
there already):

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

To switch on the polder routine, add the following line to the
'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulatePolders\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Now you are ready to run the model. If you want to compare the model
results both with and without the inclusion of polders, you can switch
off the simulation of polders either by:

3.  Removing the 'simulatePolders' statement from the 'lfoptions
    element, or

4.  changing it into \<setoption name=\"simulatePolders\" choice=\"0\"
    /\>

Both have exactly the same effect. You don't need to change anything in
either 'lfuser' or 'lfbinding'; all file definitions here are simply
ignored during the execution of the model.

Polder output files
-------------------

The polder routine produces 2 additional time series and one map (or
stack of maps, depending on the value of LISFLOOD variable
*ReportSteps*), as listed in the following table:

Note that you can use the map with the polder level at the last time
step to define the initial conditions of a succeeding simulation, e.g.:

\<textvar name=\"PolderInitialLevelValue\"
value=\"/mycatchment/hpol0000.730\"\>

Limitations
-----------

For the moment, polders can be simulated on channel pixels where dynamic
wave routing is used. For channels where the kinematic wave is used, the
routine will not work and may lead to numerical instabilities or even
model crashes. This limitation may be resolved in future model versions.

Annex 3: Simulation of lakes
============================

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD lake routine, and how it is used. The
simulation of lakes is *optional*, and it can be activated by adding the
following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulateLakes\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Lakes can be simulated on channel pixels where kinematic wave routing is
used. The routine does *not* work for channel stretches where the
dynamic wave is used!

Description of the lake routine 
--------------------------------

Lakes are simulated as points in the channel network. Figure A3.1 shows
all computed in- and outgoing fluxes. Lake inflow equals the channel
flow upstream of the lake location. The flow out of the lake is computed
using the following rating curve (e.g. Maidment, 1992):

\$${O\_{lake}} = A{(H - {H\_0})\^B}\$$

  O~lake~   : Lake outflow rate \[m^3^ s^-1^\]
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------
  H         : Water level in lake \[m\]
  H~0~      : Water level at which lake outflow is zero \[m\]
  A, B      : Constants \[-\]

![lakes](media/media/image45.png){width="5.375in"
height="3.5104166666666665in"}

*Figure A3.1 Schematic overview of the simulation of lakes.* H~0~ *is
the water level at which the outflow is zero;* H *is the water level in
the lake and* EW *is the evaporation from the lake*

Both *H* and *H~0~* can be defined relative to an arbitrary reference
level. Since the outflow is a function of the *difference* between both
levels, the actual value of this reference level doesn't matter if *H*
\> *H~0~*. However, it is advised to define both *H* and *H~0~* relative
to the *average bottom level* of the lake. This will result in more
realistic simulations during severe drought spells, when the water level
drops below *H~0~* (in which case lake outflow ceases). The value of
constant *A* can be approximated by the width of the lake outlet in
meters, and *B* is within the range 1.5-2 (reference?). Lake evaporation
occurs at the potential evaporation rate of an open water surface.

Initialisation of the lake routine
----------------------------------

Because lakes (especially large ones) tend to produce a relatively slow
response over time, it is important to make sure that the initial lake
level is set to a more or less sensible value. Just as is the case with
the initialisation of the lower groundwater zone, LISFLOOD has a special
option that will compute a steady-state lake level and use this as the
initial value. The steady-state level is computed from the water balance
of the lake. If *V~l~* is the total lake volume \[m^3^\], the rate of
change of *V~l~* at any moment is given by the continuity equation:

\$$\\frac{{d{V\_l}}}{{dt}} = I(t) - O(t)\$$

where *I* and *O* are the in- and outflow rates, respectively. For a
steady-state situation the storage remains constant, so:

\$$\\frac{{d{V\_l}}}{{dt}} = 0\\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad I(t) - O(t)
= 0\$$

Substituting all in- and outflow terms gives:

\$${I\_l} - E{W\_l} - A{(H - {H\_0})\^B} = 0\$$

where *I~l~* is the inflow into the lake and *EW~l~* the lake
evaporation (both expressed in m^3^ s^-1^). Re-arranging gives the
steady-state lake level:



LISFLOOD calculates the steady-state lake level based on a user-defined
average net inflow (=*I~l~* -- *EW~l~*). The average net inflow can be
estimated using measured discharge and evaporation records. If measured
discharge is available just *downstream* of the lake (i.e. the
*outflow*), the (long-term) average outflow can be used as the net
inflow estimate (since, for a steady state situation, inflow equals
outflow). If only inflow is available, all average inflows should be
summed, and the average lake evaporation should be subtracted from this
figure. Table A3.1 gives a worked example. Be aware that the calculation
can be less straightforward for very large lakes with multiple inlets
(which are not well represented by the current point approach anyway).

Preparation of input data 
--------------------------

The lake locations defined on a (nominal) map called '*lakes.map*'. It
is important that all reservoirs are located on a channel pixel (you can
verify this by displaying the reservoirs map on top of the channel map).
Also, since each lake receives its inflow from its upstream neighbouring
channel pixel, you may want to check if each lake has any upstream
channel pixels at all (if not, the lake will just gradually empty during
a model run!). The lake characteristics are described by 4 tables. Table
3.2 lists all required input.

When you create the map with the lake locations, pay special attention
to the following: if a lake is located on the most downstream cell (i.e.
the outflow point, see Figure A3.2), the lake routine may produce
erroneous output. In particular, the mass balance errors cannot be
calculated correctly in that case. The same applies if you simulate only
a sub-catchment of a larger map (by selecting the subcatchment in the
mask map). This situation can usually be avoided by extending the mask
map by one cell in downstream direction.

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

All in- and output files need to be defined in the settings file. If you
are using a default LISFLOOD settings template, all file definitions are
already defined in the 'lfbinding' element. Just make sure that the map
with the lake locations is in the "maps" directory, and all tables in
the 'tables" directory. If this is the case, you only have to specify
the initial lake level and --if you are using the steady-state option-
the mean net lake inflow (make this a map if you're simulating multiple
lakes simultaneously). Both can be set in the 'lfuser' element.
*LakeInitialLevelValue* can be either a map or a single value. Setting
*LakeInitialLevelValue* to *-9999* will cause LISFLOOD to calculate the
steady-state level. So we add this to the 'lfuser' element (if it is not
there already):

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Finally, you have to tell LISFLOOD that you want to simulate lakes! To
do this, add the following statement to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulateLakes\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Now you are ready to run the model. If you want to compare the model
results both with and without the inclusion of lakes, you can switch off
the simulation of lakes either by:

5.  Removing the 'simulateLakes' statement from the 'lfoptions element,
    or

6.  changing it into \<setoption name=\"simulateLakes\" choice=\"0\" /\>

Both have exactly the same effect. You don't need to change anything in
either 'lfuser' or 'lfbinding'; all file definitions here are simply
ignored during the execution of the model.

Lake output files
-----------------

The lake routine produces 4 additional time series and one map (or
stack), as listed in the following table:

[]{#_Toc353538887 .anchor}**Annex 4: Inflow hydrograph option**

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD inflow hydrograph routine, and how it
is used. Inflow hydrographs are *optional*, and can be activated by
adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"inflow\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Description of the inflow hydrograph routine
--------------------------------------------

When using the inflow hydrograph option, time series of discharge
\[m^3^/s\] are added at some user-defined location(s) on the channel
network. The inflow is added as side-flow in the channel routing
equations (this works for both kinematic and dynamic wave). *Negative*
inflows (i.e. outflows) are also possible, but large outflow rates may
sometimes result in numerical problems in the routing equations. If you
use a negative inflow rate, we advise to carefully inspect the model
output for any signs of numerical problems (i.e. strange oscillations in
simulated discharge, generation of missing values). Also check the mass
balance time series after your simulation (numerical problems often
result in unusually large mass balance errors).

Using inflow hydrographs 
-------------------------

The table below lists the input requirements for the inflow hydrograph
option. All you need is a map that defines where you want to add the
inflow, and a time series with the corresponding inflow rates.

  --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---------------------------------- ----------- -------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---------------------------------- ----------- -------------

Using the inflow hydrograph option involves four steps:

1.  Create a (nominal) PCRaster map with unique identifiers that point
    to the location(s) where you want to insert the inflow hydrograph(s)

2.  Save the inflow hydrograph(s) in PCRaster time series format; inflow
    hydrographs need to be given in \[m^3^ s^-1^\]

  **IMPORTANT**: PCRaster assumes that the first data series in the time series file (i.e. the second column, since the first column contains the time step number) corresponds to unique identifier 1 on the *InflowPoints* map; the second series to unique identifier 2, and so on. So, even if your *InflowPoints* map only contains (as an example) identifiers 3 and 4, you *still need to include the columns for identifiers 1 and 2*!! The best thing to do in such a case is to fill any unused columns with zeroes (0). Also, your inflow hydrograph time series should always start at *t=1*, even if you set *StepStart* to some higher value. For more info on time series files please have a look at the PCRaster documentation.

4.  Activate the inflow hydrograph option

Add the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"inflow\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Now you are ready to run the model with the inflow hydrograph.

Substituting subcatchments with measured inflow hydrographs
-----------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common uses of the inflow hydrograph option is this:
suppose we have a catchment where we only want to simulate the
downstream part. If measured time series of discharge are available for
the upstream catchment(s), we can use these to represent the inflow into
the more downstream part. Figure A4.1 shows an example, where we have
measured discharge of subcatchment *A* (just before it enters the main
river). In this case it is important to pay special attention to two
issues.

### Exclude subcatchments from MaskMap 

First, make sure that subcatchment *A* is *excluded* (i.e. have
boolean(0) or missing value) on LISFLOOD's *MaskMap* (which defines
which pixels are included in the calculations and which are not). If you
include it, LISFLOOD will first *simulate* discharge coming out of
subcatchment *A*, and then *add* the (measured) inflow on top of it! Of
course this doesn't make any sense, so always be careful which areas are
included in your simulation and which are not.

*Figure A4.1 Using the inflow hydrograph using measured discharge of
subcatchment A. MaskMap must have boolean(0) (or missing value) for
subcatchment A, see text for explanation.*

### Make sure your inflow points are where you need them

If you already have all gauge locations on a PCRaster map, these mostly
cannot be used directly as inflow hydrograph locations. The reason is
simple: suppose --in our previous example-- we know the outflow point of
subcatchment *A*. This point is the most downstream point within that
subcatchment. However, the flow out of subcatchment *A* is actually
added to the main river one cell downstream! Also, if we exclude
subcatchment *A* from our simulation (as explained in the foregoing),
this means we also exclude the outflow point of that subcatchment.
Because of this, *inflow* points into the main river are usually located
one pixel downstream of the *outflow* points of the corresponding
subcatchment. If you already have a (nominal) map of of your
subcatchments, a PCRaster script exists that automatically calculates
the corresponding out- and inflow points.

[]{#_Toc353538894 .anchor}**Annex 5: Double kinematic wave option**

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD double kinematic wave routine, and how
it is used. Double kinematic wave routing is *optional*, and can be
activated by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"SplitRouting\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Background
----------

The flow routing is done by the kinematic wave approach. Therefore two
equations have to be solved:



continuity equation momentum equation as expressed by Chow et al. 1988

Which decreasing inflow the peaks of the resulting outflow will be later
in time (see figure A5.1 for a simple kinematic wave calculation). The
wave propagation slows down because of more friction on the boundaries.

![](media/media/image47.emf){width="5.864583333333333in"
height="2.75in"}

**Figure A5.1** Simulated outflow for different amount of inflow\
wave propagation gets slower

This is realistic if your channel looks like in figure A5.2:

![](media/media/image48.emf){width="2.05in"
height="1.5270833333333333in"}![](media/media/image49.emf){width="1.9465277777777779in"
height="1.45in"}

**Figure A5.2** Schematic cross section of a channel with different
water level

But a natural channel looks more like this:

![](media/media/image50.emf){width="4.033333333333333in"
height="1.617361111111111in"}

**Figure A5.3** Schematic cross section of a natural channel

Which means, opposite to the kinematic wave theory, the wave propagation
gets slower as the discharge is increasing, because friction is going up
on floodplains with shrubs, trees, bridges. Some of the water is even
stored in the floodplains (e.g. retention areas, seepage retention). As
a result of this, a single kinematic wave cannot cover these different
characteristics of floods and floodplains.

Double kinematic wave approach
------------------------------

The double kinematic approach splits up the channel in two parts (see
figure A5.4):

1\. bankful routing

2\. over bankful routing

![](media/media/image54.emf){width="3.142361111111111in"
height="1.3833333333333333in"}![](media/media/image55.emf){width="1.95in"
height="1.375in"}

F**igure A5.4** Channel is split in a bankful and over bankful routing

Similar methods are used since the 1970s e.g. as multiple linear or non
linear storage cascade (Chow, 1988). The former forecasting model for
the River Elbe (ELBA) used a three stages approach depending on
discharge (Fröhlich, 1996).

Using double kinematic wave 
----------------------------

No additional maps or tables are needed for initializing the double
kinematic wave. A normal run ('InitLisflood'=0) requires an additional
map derived from the prerun ('InitLisflood'=1). A 'warm' start (using
initial values from a previous run) requires two additional maps with
state variables for the second (over 'bankful' routing).

2.  Activate the transmission loss option

Add the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"SplitRouting\" choice=\"1\" /\>

3.  Run LISFLOOD first with

    \<setoption name=\"InitLisflood\" choice=\"1\" /\>

and it will produce a map of average discharge \[m^3^/s\] in the initial
folder. This map is used together with the QSplitMult factor to set the
value for the second line of routing to start.

For a 'warm start' these initial values are needed (see also table A5.1)

Automatic change of the number of sub steps (optional)
------------------------------------------------------

For the new method the kinematic wave has to be applied two times.

The calculation of kinematic wave is the most time consuming part in a
LISFLOOD run (in general but also depending on the catchment). The use
of the double kinematic wave makes it necessary to calculate the
kinematic wave two times and increasing the computing time. To
counteract this, an option is put in place to change automatically the
number of sub steps for channel routing.

Double kinematic wave routing is *optional*, and can be activated by
adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"VarNoSubStepChannel\" choice=\"1\" /\>

This will calculate the number of sub steps for the kinematic wave
according to the discharge. Less number of steps for low and average
flow condition, more sub steps for flooding condition because the higher
velocity of water.

Activating this option needs to be done before the prerun
('InitLisflood'=1) because the maximum celerity of wave propagation
(chanckinmax.map) is created as another initial map and used in the
'normal' runs.

The minimum and maximum number of sub steps can be set in the settings
file:

[]{#_Toc353538900 .anchor}**Annex 6: Dynamic wave option**

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD dynamic wave routine, and how it is
used. The current implementation of the dynamic wave function in
PCRaster is not a complete dynamic wave formulation according to the
summary of the Saint Venant equations as discussed in Chow (1988). The
implementation currently consists of the friction force term, the
gravity force term and the pressure force term and should therefore be
correctly characterised as a diffusion wave formulation. The equations
are solved as an explicit, finite forward difference scheme. A
straightforward iteration using an Euler solution scheme is used to
solve these equations. Dynamic wave routing is *optional*, and can be
activated by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"dynamicWave\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Time step selection
-------------------

The current dynamic wave implementation requires that all equations are
solved using a time step that is much smaller (order of magnitude:
seconds-minutes) than the typical overall time step used by LISFLOOD
(order of magnitude: hours-day). More specifically, during one (sub)
time step no water should be allowed to travel more than 1 cell
downstream, i.e.:

\$$\\Delta \'{t\_{dyn}} \\le \\frac{{\\Delta x}}{{V + {c\_d}}}\$$

where *∆'t~dyn~* is the sub-step for the dynamic wave \[seconds\], *∆x*
is the length of one channel element (pixel) \[m\], *V* is the flow
velocity \[m s^-1^\] and *c~d~* is dynamic wave celerity \[m s^-1^\].
The dynamic wave celerity can be calculated as (Chow, 1988):

\$${c\_d} = \\sqrt {gy} \$$

where *g* is the acceleration by gravity \[m s^-2^\] and *y* is the
depth of flow \[m\]. For a cross-section of a regular geometric shape,
*y* can be calculated from the channel dimensions. Since the current
dynamic wave routine uses irregularly shaped cross-section data, we
simply assume than *y* equals the water level above the channel bed. The
flow velocity is simply:

\$$V = {Q\_{ch}}/A\$$

where *Q~ch~* is the discharge in the channel \[m^3^ s^-1^\], and *A*
the cross-sectional area \[m^2^\].

The Courant number for the dynamic wave, *C~dyn~*, can now be computed
as:


where *∆t* is the overall model time step \[s\]. The number of sub-steps
is then given by:



where *C~dyn,crit~* is the critical Courant number. The maximum value of
the critical Courant number is 1; in practice it is safer to use a
somewhat smaller value (although if you make it too small the model
becomes excessively slow). It is recommended to stick to the default
value (0.4) that is used the settings file template.

Input data 
-----------

A number of addition input files are necessary to use the dynamic wave
option. First, the channel stretches for which the dynamic wave is to be
used are defined on a Boolean map. Next, a cross-section identifier map
is needed that links the (dynamic wave) channel pixels to the
cross-section table (see further on). A channel bottom level map
describes the bottom level of the channel (relative to sea level).
Finally, a cross-section table describes the relationship between water
height (*H*), channel cross-sectional area (*A*) and wetted perimeter
(*P*) for a succession of *H* levels.

The following table lists all required input:

Layout of the cross-section parameter table
-------------------------------------------

The cross-section parameter table is a text file that contains --for
each cross-section- a sequence of water levels (*H*) with their
corresponding cross-sectional area (*A*) and wetted perimeter (*P*). The
format of each line is as follows:

> ID H A P

Note here that the first *H*-level is always 0, for which *A* and *P*
are (of course) 0 as well. For the last line for each cross-section it
is recommended to use some very (i.e. unrealistically) high *H*-level.
The reason for doing this is that the dynamic wave routine will crash if
during a simulation a water level (or cross-sectional area) is simulated
which is beyond the range of the table. This can occur due to a number
of reasons (e.g. if the measured cross-section is incomplete, or during
calibration of the model). To estimate the corresponding values of *A*
and *P* one could for example calculate *dA/dH* and *dP/dH* over the
last two 'real' (i.e. measured) *H*-levels, and extrapolate the results
to a very high *H*-level.

The number of H/A/P combinations that are used for each cross section is
user-defined. LISFLOOD automatically interpolates in between the table
values.

Using the dynamic wave
----------------------

The 'lfuser' element contains two parameters that can be set by the
user: *CourantDynamicCrit* (which should always be smaller than 1) and a
parameter called *DynWaveConstantHeadBoundary*, which defines the
boundary condition at the most downstream cell. All remaining
dynamic-wave related input is defined in the 'lfbinding' element, and
doesn't require any changes from the user (provided that all default
names are used, all maps are in the standard 'maps' directory and the
profile table is in the 'tables' directory). In 'lfuser' this will look
like this:

Annex 7: Using the transmission loss option
===========================================

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD transmission loss routine, and how it
is used.

The term 'transmission loss' originate from electronic or communication
science and stands for: "The loss of power or voltage of a transmitted
wave or current in passing along a transmission line or path or through
a circuit device". In river systems, particularly in semi-arid and arid
region a similar effect can be observed: The loss of water along channel
reaches mainly especially during low and average flow periods. Main
reasons for this loss might be:

-   Evaporation of water inside the channel reach

-   Use of water for domestic, industrial or agricultural use

-   Leaching to lower groundwater zones

A simplified approach to model this effect has been chosen from Rao and
Maurer (1996), without the need of additional data and with only three
parameters, making calibration relatively simple.

Transmission loss is *optional*, and can be activated by adding the
following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"TransLoss\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Description of the transmission loss approach
---------------------------------------------

The approach by Rao and Maurer 1996 builds a one-parameter relationship
between the seepage ofa channel with the depth of flow. A power
relationship is then utilized for the stage-discharge relationship,
which is coupled with the seepage relationship.


>
> with: Outflow: discharge at the outflow
>
> Inflow: discharge at the Inflow (upstream)
>
> TransPower: Parameter given by the rating curve
>
> TransSub: Parameter which is to calibrate

As a main difference to the Rao and Maurer 1996, the TransPower
parameter is not calculated by using a rating curve but is estimated
(calibrated) as the parameter TransSub. Transmission loss takes place
where the channel gets bigger with more influence of river-aquifer
interaction and also with more river-floodplain interaction. Therefore a
minimum upstream area is defined where transmission loss starts to get
important.

Using transmission loss 
------------------------

No additional maps or tables are needed. Using the transmission loss
option involves two steps:

    you want to use):

Annex 8: Including water use
============================

Introduction
------------

This annex describes the LISFLOOD water use routine, and how it is used.

The water use routine can be used to assess the effect of water
withdrawal from different sectors to the water balance. Sectors can be
public, industrial, agricultural or energy water withdrawal. As input
LISFLOOD needs a stack of maps for one representative year of total
water withdrawal demand. According to the available water LISFLOOD
calculates if this demand can be fulfilled and removes the possible
amount of withdrawal water from the river system. Water use is
*optional*, and can be activated by adding the following line to the
'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"wateruse\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Calculation of water use
------------------------

The water is withdrawn only from discharge in the river network but not
from soil, groundwater or directly from precipitation.

-   For each single day a total demand of withdrawal water is loaded
    from a sparse stack of maps

-   Water use is taken from the discharge in the river network. First
    the water use is taken from the same grid cell (see figure A8.1 --
    pixel No. 1)

-   If the amount of water withdrawal is larger than the water available
    in this grid cell water is taken from downstream moving along the
    local drain direction. This is done by implementing a loop
    substracting the remaining water from the next downstream cell till
    all the water for water use is taken or a predefined number of
    iteration is reached (see figure A8.1 -- pixel No. 2 to 5)

height="2.134514435695538in"}

**Figure A8.1** Water withdrawal assessing demand and availability along
the flow path

In the settings.xml you can define:

-   the percentage of water that must remain in a grid cell and is not
    withdrawn by water use (WUsePercRemain)

-   the maximum number of loops (= distance to the water demand cell).
    For example in figure 8.1: maxNoWateruse = 5

Table A8.1 gives an overview about the maps and table needed for the
water use option.

  ----------------------------------------------- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------- ----------- --

A sparse map stack of one year of total water withdrawal \[m^3^/s\] with
a map every 10 days or a month is needed. Because it is assumed that
water use follows a yearly circle, this map stack is used again and
again for the following years. For example:

+--------+--------------+
| **t ** | **map name** |
+========+==============+
| 1      | wuse0000.001 |
+--------+--------------+
| 2      | wuse0000.032 |
+--------+--------------+
| 3      | wuse0000.060 |
+--------+--------------+
| 4      | wuse0000.091 |
+--------+--------------+
| 5      | wuse0000.121 |
+--------+--------------+
| 6      | wuse0000.152 |
+--------+--------------+
| 7      | wuse0000.182 |
+--------+--------------+
| 8      | wuse0000.213 |
+--------+--------------+
| 9      | wuse0000.244 |
+--------+--------------+
| 10     | wuse0000.274 |
|        |              |
| 11     | wuse0000.305 |
|        |              |
| 12     | wuse0000.335 |
+--------+--------------+

To assign each day of simulation the right map a lookup table
(WUseOfDay.txt) is necessary:

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

All in- and output files need to be defined in the settings file. If you
are using a default LISFLOOD settings template, all file definitions are
already defined in the 'lfbinding' element.

Finally, you have to tell LISFLOOD that you want to simulate water use.
To do this, add the following statement to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"wateruse\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Water use output files
----------------------

The water use routine can produce 2 additional time series and one map
(or stack), as listed in the following table:

Annex 9: Simulation and reporting of water levels
=================================================

Introduction
------------

Within LISFLOOD it is possible to simulate and report water levels in
the channel. The simulation of water levels is *optional*, and it can be
activated by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions' element:

\<setoption name=\"simulateWaterLevels\" choice=\"1\" /\>

If the option is switched on, water levels are calculated for channel
pixels where either kinematic or dynamic wave routing is used. Using
this option does *not* influence the actual model results in any way,
and it is included only to allow the model user to report water levels.
The actual *reporting* of the simulated water levels (as time series or
maps) can be activated using two separate options.

Calculation of water levels
---------------------------

For channel stretches that are simulated using the dynamic wave, the
water level in the channel is simply the difference between the channel
head and the channel bottom level. For kinematic wave stretches, only
approximate water levels can be estimated from the cross-sectional
(wetted) channel area, *A~ch~* for each time step. Since the channel
cross-section is described as a trapezoid, water levels follow directly
from *A~ch~* , channel bottom width, side slope and bankfull level. If
*A~ch~* exceeds the bankfull cross-sectional area (*A~bf~*), the surplus
is distributed evenly over the (rectangular) floodplain, and the depth
of water on the floodplain is added to the (bankfull) channel depth.
Figure A9.1 below further illustrates the cross-section geometry. All
water levels are relative to channel bottom level (*z~bot~* in the
Figure).

cross-sectional area at bankfull;* A~fp~*: floodplain cross-sectional
area;* D~bf~*:* *bankfull channel depth,* D~fp~*: depth of water on the
floodplain*

In order to calculate water levels, LISFLOOD needs a map with the with
of the floodplain in \[m\], which is defined by 'lfbinding' variable
*FloodPlainWidth* (the default name of this map is *chanfpln.map*).

Reporting of water levels
-------------------------

Water levels can be reported as time series (at the gauge locations that
are also used for reporting discharge), or as maps.

To generate a time series, add the following line to the 'lfoptions'
element of your settings file:

\<setoption name=\"repWaterLevelTs\" choice=\"1\" /\>

For maps, use the following line instead:

\<setoption name=\"repWaterLevelMaps\" choice=\"1\" /\>

In either case, the reporting options should be used *in addition* to
the 'simulateWaterLevels' option. If you do not include the
'simulateWaterLevels' option, there will be nothing to report and
LISFLOOD will exit with an error message.

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

The naming of the reported water level time series and maps is defined
in the settings file. If you are using a default LISFLOOD settings
template, all file definitions are already defined in the 'lfbinding'
element.

Annex 10: Simulation and reporting of soil moisture as pF values
================================================================

Introduction
------------

LISFLOOD offers the possibility to calculate pF values from the moisture
content of both soil layers. The calculation of pF values is *optional*,
and it can be activated by adding the following line to the 'lfoptions'
element:

\<setoption name=\"simulatePF\" choice=\"1\" /\>

Using this option does *not* influence the actual model results in any
way, and it is included only to allow the model user to report pF time
series or maps. The actual *reporting* of the computed pF values (as
time series or maps) can be activated using separate options (which are
discussed further on).

Calculation of pF
-----------------

A soil's pF is calculated as the logarithm of the capillary suction
head, *h*:


with *h* in \[cm\] (positive upwards). Values of pF are typically within
the range 1.0 (very wet) to 5.0 (very dry). The relationship between
soil moisture status and capillary suction head is described by the Van
Genuchten equation (here again re-written in terms of mm water slice,
instead of volume fractions):



where *h* is the suction head \[cm\], and *w*, *w~r~* and *w~s~* are the
actual, residual and maximum amounts of moisture in the soil
respectively (all in \[mm\]). Parameter *α* is related to soil texture.
Parameters *m* and *n* are calculated from the pore-size index, *λ*
(which is related to soil texture as well):

\$$n = \\lambda + 1\$$

If the soil contains no moisture at all (*w*=0), *h* is set to a fixed
(arbitrary) value of 1∙10^7^ cm.

 Reporting of pF
----------------

pF can be reported as time series (at the locations defined on the
"sites" map or as average values upstream each gauge location), or as
maps. To generate time series at the "sites", add the following line to
the 'lfoptions' element of your settings file:

\<setoption name=\"repPFTs\" choice=\"1\" /\>

For maps, use the following lines instead (for the upper and lower soil
layer, respectively):

\<setoption name=\"repPF1Maps\" choice=\"1\" /\>

\<setoption name=\"repPF2Maps\" choice=\"1\" /\>

In either case, the reporting options should be used *in addition* to
the 'simulatePF' option. If you do not include the 'simulatePF' option,
there will be nothing to report and LISFLOOD will exit with an error
message.

Preparation of settings file
----------------------------

The naming of the reported time series and maps is defined in the
settings file. Tables A7.1 and A7.2 list the settings variables default
output names. If you are using a default LISFLOOD settings template, all
file definitions are already defined in the 'lfbinding' element.

Annex 11: LISFLOOD options
==========================

As explained in Chapter 5, the 'lfoptions' element gives you additional
control over what LISFLOOD is doing. Using options it is possible to
switch certain parts of the model on or off. This way you can tell the
model exactly which output files are reported and which ones aren't.
Also, they can be used to activate a number of additional model
features, such as the simulation of reservoirs and inflow hydrographs.

The table below lists all currently implemented options and their
corresponding defaults. All currently implemented options are switches
(1= on, 0=off). You can set as many options as you want (or none at
all). Table 10.1 lists all currently implemented options[^13]. Note that
each option generally requires additional items in the settings file.
For instance, using the inflow hydrograph option requires an input map
and time series, which have to be specified in the settings file. If you
want to report discharge maps at each time step, you will first have to
specify under which name they will be written. The template settings
file that is provided with LISFLOOD always contains file definitions for
all optional output maps and time series. The use of the *output*
options is described in detail in Chapter 8.

Tables
------

In the previous version of LISFLOOD a number of model parameters are
read through tables that are linked to the classes on the land use and
soil (texture) maps. Those tables are replaced by maps (e.g. soil
hydraulic property maps) in order to include the sub-grid variability of
each parameter. Therefore only one default table is used in the standard
LISFLOOD setting

The following table gives an overview:

[^1]: Note that the model needs *daily* average temperature values, even
    if the model is run on a smaller time interval (e.g. hourly). This
    is because the routines for snowmelt and soil freezing are use
    empirical relations which are based on daily temperature data. Just
    as an example, feeding hourly temperature data into the snowmelt
    routine can result in a gross overestimation of snowmelt. This is
    because even on a day on which the average temperature is below
    *T~m~* (no snowmelt), the instantaneous (or hourly) temperature may
    be higher for a part of the day, leading to unrealistically high
    simulated snowmelt rates.

[^2]: In the LISFLOOD settings file this critical amount is currently
    expressed as an *intensity* \[mm day^-1^\]. This is because the
    equation was originally designed for a daily time step only. Because
    the current implementation will likely lead to *DSLR* being reset
    too frequently, the exact formulation may change in future versions
    (e.g. by keeping track of the accumulated available water of the
    last 24 hours).

[^3]: The file names listed in the table are not obligatory. However, it
    is suggested to stick to the default names suggested in the table.
    This will make both setting up the model for new catchments as well
    as upgrading to possible future LISFLOOD versions much easier.

[^4]: The reason why *--listoptions* produces "default=0" for the
    reservoirs option, is that --internally within the model- the
    reservoir option consists of two blocks of code: one block is the
    actual reservoir code, and another one is some dummy code that is
    activated if the reservoirs option is switched off (the dummy code
    is needed because some internal model variables that are associated
    with reservoirs need to be defined, even if no reservoirs are
    simulated). Both blocks are associated with "*simulateReservoirs=1*"
    and "*simulateReservoirs=0*", respectively, where the
    "*simulateReservoirs=0*" block is marked as the default choice. In
    case of the "*repDischargeMaps*" option, there *is* no block of code
    that is associated with "*repDischargeMaps=0*", hence formally there
    is no default value.

[^5]: Can be disabled by either option *repStateMaps=0 or setting
    ReportSteps to a high value e.g. \<textvar name=\"ReportSteps\"
    value=\"99999\"\>*

[^6]: Output time steps are defined with ReportSteps in the settings
    file (see chapter 5) or only for the last time step with option
    'repEndMaps'

[^7]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. or a
    730-step simulation the end map of 'waterdepth' will be
    'wdepth00.730', and so on.

[^8]: Output time steps are defined with ReportSteps in the settings
    file (see chapter 5) or only for the last time step with option
    'repEndMaps'

[^9]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. or a
    730-step simulation the end map of 'waterdepth' will be
    'wdepth00.730', and so on.

[^10]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. for a
    730-step simulation the name will be 'rsfil000.730', and so on.

[^11]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. for a
    730-step simulation the name will be 'hpol0000.730', and so on.

[^12]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. for a
    730-step simulation the name will be 'lakh0000.730', and so on.

[^13]: Actually, the --listoptions switch will show you a couple of
    options that are not listed in Table 6.1. These are either debugging
    options (which are irrelevant to the model user) or experimental
    features that may not be completely finalised (and thus remain
    undocumented here until they are)

[^14]: This option can only be used in combination with the
    'simulateWaterLevels' option!

[^15]: This option can only be used in combination with the
    'simulateWaterLevels' option!

[^16]: Deprecated; this feature may not be supported in forthcoming
    LISFLOOD releases. Use *repStateMaps* instead, which gives you the
    same maps with the added possibility to report them for any required
    time step(s).

[^17]: This option can only be used in combination with the
    'simulateWaterLevels' option!

    LISFLOOD releases. Use *repStateMaps* instead, which gives you the
    same maps with the added possibility to report them for any required
    time step(s).

    it is suggested to stick to the default names suggested in the
    table. This will make both setting up the model for new catchments
    as well as upgrading to possible future LISFLOOD versions much

[^21]: State variables represents the state of a variable at the end of

[^22]: State variables represents the state of a variable at the end of
    a time step (or beginning of the next time step (e.g. Hiking
    analogy: walked kilometer till the first break)

[^23]: Rate variable represents the average flux between beginning and
    end of a time step (e.g. hiking analogy: speed of walking during the
    first part)

[^24]: Output time steps are defined with ReportSteps in the settings
    file (see chapter 5) or only for the last time step with option
    'repEndMaps'

[^25]: xxx represents the number of the last time step; e.g. or a
    730-step simulation the end map of 'waterdepth' will be
    'wdepth00.730', and so on.
